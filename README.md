# MedExplain: a tool to automatically translate cutting edge 
Medical research progresses at a blinding pace, however children are not always exposed to the latest research. MedExplain is a tool that aims to bridge this gap by automatically translating cutting edge medical research into language that is accessible to children. This tool will allow children that are interested in medicine to stay up to date written in language and at a level that they can understand.
