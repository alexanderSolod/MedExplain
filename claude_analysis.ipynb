This finding builds on previous studies that determined that alterations in a gene known asCACNA1Care linked to increased risk of cognitive impairment and mental illness.CACNA1Cencodes calcium channels that enable the flow of calcium ions into neurons. For years, researchers have known that gain-of-function mutations in this gene, which can create more of these calcium channels, raise the risk for cognitive disorders, but they did not understand why this increase was harmful to the prefrontal cortex, which generates higher cognition and the executive functions.Now, a Yale team has discovered that excessive calcium channel activation in the prefrontal cortex  is associated with reduced neuronal firing, which in turn hinders cognition. The researchers published their findings inJAMA Psychiatryon May 22.\\u201cTrying to learn what causes these complex cognitive disorders is an enormous challenge, especially when they\\u2019re attacking our most recently evolved brain circuits \\u2014 you can\\u2019t just mimic this in a dish,\\u201d saysAmy Arnsten, PhD, Albert E. Kent Professor of Neuroscience, who is the study\\u2019s senior author. \\u201cStudies like this are some of the rare bridges between the molecular biology and the symptoms we see in humans, allowing us to understand what these circuits need to function properly, as well as their vulnerabilities.\\u201dA link between calcium and abstract thoughtTo learn more about howCACNA1Cmutations could increase risk of cognitive disorders, the researchers turned their attention to a group of cells known as layer III pyramidal cells. These are neurons in the prefrontal cortex that are highly important for the brain\\u2019s executive functions, such as abstract thinking and working memory. This group of cells is vulnerable to atrophy and neurodegeneration while, interestingly, their nearby neighbors typically remain unaffected.Arnsten\\u2019s team employed a variety of methods, including running transcriptomic analyses (explorations of all RNA molecules in a cell) of human and animal pyramidal cells, to investigate these neurons\\u2019 susceptibility to dysfunction and their potential link toCACNA1Calteration. The researchers found that these neurons expressed signatures indicative of high calcium, including an assembly of calcium-related proteins.The team then embarked on more in-depth studies of these molecules, including in animal models. Their findings suggest that increased calcium in pyramidal cells is necessary for higher cognition. \\u201cWe found evidence that these neurons require higher calcium to maintain their firing over many seconds to represent information that isn\\u2019t actually happening,\\u201d says Arnsten. \\u201cThat\\u2019s the foundation of abstract thought.\\u201dThe researchers then  infused a drug that mimics the stress response next to the prefrontal neurons. They found that stress activated the calcium channels, which in turn opened nearby potassium channels to stop the neurons from firing. \\u201cEver have your mind go blank when you get bad news or have to do public speaking?\\u201d said Arnsten. \\u201c That\\u2019s likely involving this mechanism.\\u201dClues for treating schizophrenia and Alzheimer\\u2019s diseaseThese findings have significant clinical implications for understanding the pathologies of cognitive disorders, including schizophrenia and Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, both of which are characterized by profound prefrontal cortex dysfunction. Previous research has shown, for example, that gain-of-function mutations inCACNA1Craise risk for schizophrenia. The study offers evidence that the increase in calcium resulting from these mutations can lead to the atrophy associated with the condition.Furthermore, the team\\u2019s transcriptomic analyses revealed that the pyramidal cells contain calbindin, a calcium-binding protein that plays an essential role in maintaining calcium homeostasis. However, over time, this important balance can be altered by aging or inflammation. Prior research has shown that elevated calcium can propel tau pathology, a characteristic of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, in which tau proteins become hyperphosphorylated and form tangles in the brain. Thus, as pyramidal cells in the prefrontal cortex age and lose calbindin, they become vulnerable to the neurodegenerative disorder.Arnsten hopes these insights will lead to greater understanding of and, ultimately, better treatments for these conditions. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve uncovered big clues about which brain cells are most vulnerable and which are resilient,\\u201d she says. \\u201cIf we can learn why certain cells are vulnerable, that also gives us clues about how to protect them.\\u201d\"], [\"How Can Artificial Intelligence Advance Medical Education and Research to Transform Patient Care?\", \"Over the past few years, there has been tremendous advancement in artificial intelligence (AI). Faculty from across the Yale Department of Internal Medicine are using AI as a tool to help improve the way they learn, teach, conduct research, and advance the field of medicine.\\u201cYale has always been a leader in research and in educating the next generation of physicians and scientists,\\u201d saidGary D\\u00e9sir, MD, Paul B. Beeson Professor of Medicine, chair of the Department of Internal Medicine, and vice provost for Faculty Development and Diversity. \\u201cBy using the power of AI, we are unlocking new opportunities to improve the way we conduct research and teach students\\u2014all with the ultimate goal of making health care better for our patients.\\u201dThese are just a few of the ways in which Yale faculty are leveraging the power of AI to transform their work.GutGPT: Learning from a New GI Team MemberA new study in theYale Center for Healthcare Simulationis exploring how emergency physician residents, internal medicine residents, and medical students interact with a new generative AI tool, GutGPT. GutGPT uses a specific technique called \\u2018retrieval augmented generation,\\u2019 which gives the generative AI tool trusted information, like clinical guidelines, pathways, and journal articles, that can be cited.During the simulation, participants are asked to treat hypothetical patients with a gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding disorder using synthetic patient data. Each participant is randomly assigned either a dashboard or chatbot interface that allows them to askGutGPT questions to get the information they need quickly. The study aims to measure the usability and trust of the tool compared to other interfaces.\\u201cAsking ChatGPT a question at home is not the same as in a medical setting,\\u201d saidDennis Shung, MD, MHS, PhD, assistantprofessor of medicine (digestive diseases) and director of Applied Artificial Intelligence at the Yale Center for Healthcare Simulation, who is leading the research. \\u201cAt home, you have low stakes and unlimited time. So, we need to test how clinicians will interact with this type of generative AI in a more realistic setting to understand how AI might be most useful in a clinical setting.\\u201dThe research study is bidirectional: students and residents learn how to care for patients with upper GI disorders and the capabilities and limitations of using AI in a clinical setting, while Shung and his team can learn how different team members interact with different types of AI tools.While the study is still in its early stages, Shung says that the simulation center is helping them quickly learn that people use AI differently depending on their roles and experience levels. This information is critical to helping them refine GutGPT so that it can be more useful to each person.\\u201cWe think the biggest value is for residents, who know so much but may need reminders to have confidence in the decisions. We also see value for interdisciplinary teams, since advanced practice providers such as NPs or PAs with a lot of clinical experience are an essential part of health care systems. Having access to a tested, reliable, generative AI team member could help inform their practice,\\u201d said Shung.While some have fears that AI may replace the role of the physician, Shung thinks a well-trained AI tool like GutGPT will only help improve care.\\u201cModern health care has already become a team sport because we recognize that not one person can have all the expertise. AI is just another member of the team with perfect memory who has spent a lot of time looking up a bunch of papers and is now here saying, \\u2018Hey! I\\u2019ve read the guidelines; on page 137, it says to do this,\\u201d said Shung. \\u201cYou are still leading the team. You have to take the expertise from across the team and decide how to use it to make a clinical judgment.\\u201dShung and his team published early results of the study in Machine Learning for Health in 2023 and expect additional publications to follow soon.Improving Health Equity in the Medical School Curriculum with Help from AIKelsey Martin, MD, assistant professor of medicine (hematology) and associate director for medical education atWomen\\u2019s Health Research at Yale,Margaret Pisani, MD, MPH, professor of medicine (pulmonary, critical care, and sleep medicine) andCarolyn M. Mazure, PhD, Norma Weinberg Spungen and Joan Lebson Bildner Professor (women\\u2019s health research) are co-leading anew effortto integrate information about sex, gender, and women\\u2019s health into the medical school curriculum to better teach medical students about how sex and gender impact health and disease.\\u201cHistorically, women were largely excluded as research participants beyond studies related to reproduction, but that is improving and changing. It\\u2019s critical that we bring updated data on the impact of sex and gender on health into medical education and bridge that gap for the next generation of doctors,\\u201d said Martin.Martin and Pisani have started working with faculty members to analyze their existing curriculum and highlight areas for updates. The challenge is that the Yale medical school curriculum is vast, and combing through the syllabi, PowerPoint lectures, clinical case workshops, and other content is time-consuming.\\u201cTime is the biggest constraint to this type of work,\\u201d said Martin. \\u201cIt takes a lot of time to analyze all of this content.\\u201dAt the suggestion of one of their team members,Haleigh Larson, a third-year medical student at Yale, they started usingHumata.aito help cull through the medical curriculum. The research team, which also includesAeka Guru, an undergraduate fellow, developed a question list for input into Humata.ai so it could assess sex and gender content in the curriculum and generate a course report. Questions included: \\u2018Is there any discussion of sex and/or gender in the document?\\u2019 \\u2018What areas could benefit from discussion of sex and gender topics?\\u2019 \\u2018What journals have papers with information on these topics?\\u2019 among others. The Humata.ai tool then performed an initial content analysis to assess sex and gender content in the curriculum and develop suggestions for incorporating new information.Once the AI tool completes its initial analysis, Martin, Pisani, and their project team review and refine the analysis, noting information like when case studies are only focused on males or missing information on patient sex and/or gender, or which topics could enrich educational content, before sharing it with the relevant faculty member.\\u201cUsing AI has made this process faster and more efficient. The feedback we\\u2019ve received so far has been very positive,\\u201d said Martin. \\u201cMany of our faculty have been teaching for a long time, and this allows them to see information in their course in a new light.\\u201d The team is also planning to get feedback from students about the existing curriculum and proposed updates. The curriculum is also a key component of the medical school\\u2019sHealth Equity Thread.After the team finishes combing through the existing curriculum, they plan to develop a tool or a process so that faculty can iteratively update their course content to reflect the latest scientific information.\\u201cScience and medicine are changing so rapidly. As educators, we want to teach our students the most up-to-date knowledge, like how different diseases might manifest differently depending on a person\\u2019s sex or which treatment option might work best for a patient,\\u201d said Pisani. \\u201cWe know that updating case studies and reframing lectures takes time. By making this process more efficient, we hope to break down some of the barriers to curriculum change.\\u201dMartin agrees and says she\\u2019s confident that using AI to assess and update curriculum will help get insights to faculty faster.\\u201cWe\\u2019re lifelong learners in medicine. AI offers another tool we can learn from,\\u201d Martin said. \\u201cWe\\u2019re just beginning to scratch the surface of how AI can be used in other aspects of medical education. There are so many more opportunities for creativity and collaboration.\\u201dScreening the Heart with AIMost cardiologists use technology such as electrocardiograms (ECGs), ultrasounds, or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs) to detect and diagnose heart conditions. While these imaging tools are critical to diagnosing and treating cardiovascular disease, there is a limit to what the human eye can detect.\\u201cWe have a moving, beating heart, and while we can measure and visualize what\\u2019s happening, we can only summarize what we see to a level where we can comprehend,\\u201d saidRohan Khera, MD, MS, assistant professor of medicine (cardiovascular medicine) and director of theCardiovascular Data Science (CarDS) Lab. \\u201cAI can look at the same video and learn what\\u2019s happening from frame to frame and beat to beat to help us understand the small and long-term changes that happen over the full cardiac cycle.\\u201dKhera and his colleagues at the lab are working to harness the power of AI to develop state-of-the-art models that can help detect cardiovascular diseases through common imaging modalities. They recentlypublished a paperidentifying an AI-based biomarker to diagnose aortic stenosis, a common valve disorder affecting more than 2.5 million people in the United States alone. They\\u2019ve also identified an AI-based approach that would allow for the automated screening of left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) from ECG images. Currently, screening for LVSD is often unavailable or reserved for people with symptomatic disease. The work extends beyond diagnostics to defining precise and personalized care for patients with cardiovascular disease through AI deployed to clinical trials and wearable devices.\\u201cThere is so much possibility in automating the interpretation of imaging tests to detect and diagnose some of the most common heart conditions,\\u201d said Khera. \\u201cWe see the opportunity for AI to help us diagnose these diseases earlier so that patients can start treatment sooner and reduce their risk of severe complications from their disease.\\u201dWhile these tools are not yet integrated into clinical practice, Khera is optimistic that they will one day expand access to the highest-level cardiology care for patients, especially those in low-resource settings.\\u201cNot every clinician has access to hundreds of expert cardiologists that they can consult to help read a complicated ECG,\\u201d said Khera. \\u201cAnd yet, they must still treat the patient in front of them. AI can help give clinicians a better view of the heart and help expand our capacity to deliver expert-level care in settings where it was not physically possible before.\\u201dUsing AI to Annotate a Vast Hematology Tissue BankTheYale Hematology Tissue Bankgives researchers access to critical patient samples for the study of hematologic diseases. The repository continues to grow exponentially and now has more than 3,300 patients enrolled and close to 9,000 individual samples, including blood, bone marrow biopsies, lymph nodes, saliva, pericardial fluid, and other various tissue biopsies.Each sample has been painstakingly annotated with rich clinical data. However, manual abstraction of the clinical record has been inefficient, limiting the value of the samples to researchers. Applying traditional national language processing methods for automated information extraction was not completely useful, as the technology could not fully contextualize language or generate human-like languages.\\u201cClinical research, clinical trials, and predictive algorithms all depend on digitized and structured data so that researchers can perform the analysis required to better understand and treat blood disorders,\\u201d saidStephanie Halene, MD, Dr Med, Arthur H. and Isabel Bunker Professor of Hematology, and chief of Yale Hematology. \\u201cWe have all of this incredibly rich clinical data in the Hematology Tissue Bank, but we had not found a way to extract the information in a way that was efficient and accurate.\\u201dHalene and her team reached out toWade Schulz, MD, PhD, assistant professor (laboratory medicine) and director of the CORE Center for Computational Health, who worked with them to build a hematology-specific large language model, a form of generative AI, behind a secure firewall to safeguard all data. Their goal is to ultimately annotate the entire tissue bank and build a hematology research database that researchers can search using natural language questions.While they\\u2019re still in the early stages of the project, Halene is encouraged by the potential for this tool to more accurately and efficiently extract the data that researchers need for their work.\\u201cWe see this AI tool as an opportunity to enhance the value of our repository for researchers so that they have quicker access to the detailed information they need to determine if a particular sample is appropriate to their research,\\u201d Halene said. \\u201cUltimately, we hope it will help us meet our mission to spur biomedical research to improve the care for patients with blood disorders.\\u201dThe Department of Internal Medicine at Yale is among the nation's premier departments, bringing together an elite cadre of clinicians, investigators, educators, and staff in one of the world's top medical schools.

Often patients are referred to the clinic after they have tried standard treatments without success.In a conversation, Koumpouras and Ramachandran discuss the goals of the clinic, including increasing awareness about lupus and other complex and sometimes hidden diseases, addressing barriers to clinical trial participation, and forging connections with people in the local community.Why did you establish the joint rheumatology/dermatology clinic?FK: Collaborative clinics and centers of excellence are an optimal way to treat complex, multi-system diseases. Connective tissue diseases often affect the skin and internal organs, so patients are best served by a clinic where both specialists come together to make a diagnosis and manage the condition. In our clinic, we examine patients at the same time which allows us to consolidate care to achieve a more rapid diagnosis and effective management plan.SR: After we both joined Yale in 2015, there was a concerted effort to bring our expertise together. The clinic allows us to work collaboratively, and one of our initiatives is a rheumatology dermatology conference, which brings together faculty, fellows, and residents from both departments to discuss complicated patient cases at length. It\\u2019s exciting to have experts from different disciplines together in the same room. As we review these cases, we highlight important findings and learn from each other. We\\u2019ve also invited thought leaders to come to Yale to discuss their research.How did community engagement become a cornerstone of the clinic?FK: Lupus disproportionately affects certain ethnic groups, including African Americans, East Asians, and Hispanics. Community outreach helps to provide education and increase awareness, as people with lupus often have fears about treatments and the stigma inappropriately associated with the diagnosis. Since lupus often occurs in young people, access to health care can also be difficult. The pandemic has shown us that you need community outreach to improve outcomes.SR: There has been a disconnect between the diverse people affected by lupus and the people entering lupus clinical trials. When we started the clinic, we wanted to address some of the barriers to clinical trial participation, particularly in lupus clinical trials, such as access, opportunity, mistrust, health literacy, and cultural aspects. Our goal in the past few years has been to address each of these in different ways.Why is it important to involve the community?SR: Raising awareness through community engagement can help people feel comfortable joining clinical trials or receiving therapeutic regimens. It is critical that patients feel that their health care providers understand them. When patients feel connected to their care and when they're able to meet with physicians they trust, they have better health outcomes.FK: Involving the community can help raise awareness of diseases, address unmet needs, increase funding by government or local sources, and improve the understanding that general access to health care is an important part of living.In addition to helping patients, howis community outreachbeneficial to physicians?SR: These efforts benefit physicians in many ways, including increasing participation in clinical trials to include a diverse set of patients impacted by the disease. This gives us a better understanding of how the disease is behaving and how patients who are most affected by it are responding to therapies. It\\u2019s also important for our trainees to learn how to engage with patients from various backgrounds.FK:Our clinic also focuses on therapeutic dilemmas. We are able to utilize our collective expertise to provide personalized treatment plans, including access to novel, promising treatments in our clinical trials program. Our clinical trial portfolio addresses unmet needs in lupus, including skin disease, renal disease, and brain fog.In what ways do you make an impact through outreach?FK: The effort we place on outreach translates into additional funding to help expand access at the level of both the clinic and clinical research, with the ultimate goal of improving the care of patients with lupus and finding a cure. Examples of our outreach activities include regional fundraisers and educational forums, such as the New Haven Free Public Library empowerment workshop. We interact with community leaders to help increase exposure of the disease as well as our clinic and research program.We also have a trials buddy program, a new initiative in which we pair someone who is interested in learning more about clinical trials with someone who has participated in one. They meet quarterly, either by phone or video. This is an opportunity for someone to do one-to-one outreach and talk about their condition, how their medications are impacting them, for example, and the experience of being in a research trial.We\\u2019re fortunate that Connecticut\\u2019s small geographic size gives us an opportunity to have impactful outreach across vast communities at risk for rheumatologic-dermatologic disease. We can raise community awareness about new treatment options and the expertise that now exists at Yale Medicine to tackle these disorders while advancing the state of the art using clinical trials to further the discovery of new, safer, more effective therapies.SR: We will also be rolling out a free cutaneous lupus support group for the local community. We provide free skin cancer screenings, which are relevant to some of our lupus and other patients who are immunosuppressed. We focus on patients who are underhoused and poorly insured, and we\\u2019ve distributed basic skincare products to shelters. We plan to expand our outreach even more, including to the refugee population of New Haven, to get patients engaged and involved.We\\u2019re also joining national organizations and not just looking at equity right here in our community, which is our focus, but also seeing what other institutions are doing and how we can use similar strategies.We hope that our clinic gets newer physicians excited about outreach so that this connection with the community continues for future generations.Yale School of Medicine\\u2019s Department of Internal MedicineSection of Rheumatology, Allergy and Immunology is dedicated to providing care for patients with rheumatic, allergic and immunologic disorders; educating future generations of thought leaders in the field; and conducting research into fundamental questions of autoimmunity and immunology.

These cysts enlarge the kidneys, reduce kidney function, and ultimately lead tokidney failure.While the genetic basis for inheriting the disease is well established, how this causes cyst formation is not fully understood. For decades, scientists have been seeking a better understanding of PKD and what causes cyst growth.New research from Yale School of Medicine,published inNature Communications, has discovered that the gene Glis2 is a component of PKD signaling and may also be a new target for the treatment of the disease.The moment the team discovered the gene target has been described as \\\"unforgettable\\\" byMichael Rehman, PhD, associate research scientist (nephrology) and co-first author of the paper.Another co-first author Chao Zhang, PhD, remembers the excitement, \\u201cWhen I got the first in vivo data, which showed the perfect rescue of polycystic kidneys by Glis2 knock-out, I was so excited and could not wait to share the data. At the same time, I tried really hard to calm myself down and thought about the next steps to confirm this result.\\u201dUntil now, the Glis2 gene was not included in any of the known pathways that have been investigated for polycystic kidney disease.Glis2 has not been suspected to be a component of the signaling pathways involved, but our research shows it\\u2019s quite centrally positioned in polycystin signaling.Stefan Somlo, MD, C. N. H. Long Professor of Medicine (Nephrology) and professor of genetics\\u201cGlis2 has not been suspected to be a component of the signaling pathways involved, but our research shows it\\u2019s quite centrally positioned in polycystin signaling,\\u201d saidStefan Somlo, MD, C. N. H. Long Professor of Medicine (Nephrology) and professor of genetics; chief, Section of Nephrology, and corresponding author on the study.About a decade ago, Somlo\\u2019s lab was investigating the role of cilia\\u2014minute membrane projections that cells use to sense outside signals\\u2014in polycystic kidney disease. They described a phenomenon in which polycystic kidney disease is present when polycystin genes are inactivated in cells with intact cilia, but surprisingly, they found that when the cilia were also inactivated, polycystic kidney disease was suppressed despite the absence of polycystins. This suggested there was some process that is dependent on the presence of intact cilia\\u2014and absence from those cilia of polycystins\\u2014that drives cyst growth.Building on this, Zhang, as part of his thesis project, used RNA sequencing to identify gene expression changes specifically present in polycystin knockouts with intact cilia. \\u201cAmong these genes, most of them are not well studied and completely new to ADPKD [autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease], which makes our work very hard. On the other hand, it brought us the opportunities of finding new factors or pathways,\\u201d explains Zhang. It led to the discovery of the role of Glis2 in polycystic kidney disease.One weekend, on a Sunday, I was going to throw away some cells with the Pkd1 knockout. Then I thought, instead of throwing them away, let's try to do fractionation of nuclear and cytosolic portions and test by western blot for Glis2. That evening the result that I got was one of my best observations\\u2013it validated our observations on mRNA expression at the protein level.Michael Rehman, PhD, associate research scientist (nephrology)\\u201cFor a long time, we tried to see the Glis2 protein in western blot. And one weekend, on a Sunday, I was going to throw away some cells with the Pkd1 knockout. Then I thought, instead of throwing them away, let's try to do fractionation of nuclear and cytosolic portions and test by western blot for Glis2. That evening the result that I got was one of my best observations\\u2013it validated our observations on mRNA expression at the protein level,\\u201d said Rehman.Somlo emphasizes how the approach they used was unbiased. \\u201cIn the field, there are a relatively large number of targets proposed for polycystic kidney disease, but they don't coalesce into a few common pathways. And sometimes when that happens, you have to worry that you may not have found the most compelling mechanism.\\u201d\\\"We didn't assume any specific pathway. We wondered if all we assumed was the differences in phenotype, what gene expression changes would be found between polycystin-only knockouts that form cysts when compared to both noncystic controls or noncystic polycystin and cilia double knockouts.\\u201dThe research team focused on changes in 73 genes and, ultimately, selected Glis2 as the best candidate for further validation.\\u201cAround five years ago, when I started to work in the ADPKD field, I asked many people about what markers are good to see in western blots for cells with Pkd1 KO, and no one had an answer. But, now we have Glis2 as a very robust marker after a lot of systematic analysis in multiple in vitro and in vivo models,\\u201d says Rehman.As part of the study, the investigators also treated models with antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) directed against Glis2, which they found suppressed the growth of cysts.When I found that the disease progression was significantly prevented in in vivo studies, I was very excited and realized that the Glis2 can play a crucial role in further dissecting PKD signaling and enriching our understanding of mechanisms of the human ADPKD, and also could lead to developing treatments of the disease.Xin Tian, MD, associate research scientist (neprhology)The selective inactivation of Glis2 was carried out byXin Tian, MD, associate research scientist (nephrology) and co-first author of the study. Tian evaluated preclinical models whose disease progression was similar to human disease. \\u201cWhen I found that the disease progression was significantly prevented in in vivo studies, I was very excited and realized that the Glis2 can play a crucial role in further dissecting PKD signaling and enriching our understanding of mechanisms of the human ADPKD, and also could lead to developing treatments of the disease.\\u201dOverall, the study went from discovery to genetic validation in cell culture systems and in preclinical models, and then used a therapeutic agent for further proof of concept, so this can be considered a fairly complete preclinical study, mentions Somlo.The next step in their research is to dig deeper into how Glis2 operates, including how polycystin results in the upregulation of Glis2 and what upregulation of Glis2 does functionally, and, most importantly, whether it\\u2019s applicable to humans.Co-first authors on the paper were: Chao Zhang, PhD; Michael Rehman, PhD; and Xin Tian, MD.

The new technique could help researchers better understand what\\u2019s happening inside mitochondria and other organelles of diseased cells and identify new, more precise drug targets.In a new studypublished inNatureon May 29., researchers developed a novel imaging approach by integrating two microscopy techniques \\u2014 single-particle analysis and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) \\u2014 to image mitochondria from animal models. They also developed original computational approaches to tackle bottlenecks to high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) analysis of images from the highly crowded environment.The technology enabled the team to view assemblies of proteins in their native environment within the organelle with unprecedented resolution. They also examined how inducing disease in these models altered the structures of these proteins inside the mitochondrial membrane. Their work paves the way for viewing the composition of molecules within cells at the atomic level.\\u201cPreviously, our technology was not able to reveal how interactions occur,\\u201d saysJack Zhang, PhD, assistant professor of molecular biophysics and biochemistry and principal investigator of the study. \\u201cBut in this case, we see the atoms, we see the structures of molecules, and we see how everything interacts, giving us an entirely new understanding of the mechanisms in the cellular environment.\\u201dCombining two microscopy concepts to generate high-resolution imagesCurrently, structural biologists are limited by either the resolution or achievable scales of targets of available microscopy techniques. \\u201cWe haven\\u2019t even been able to distinguish protein subunits [using conventional approaches], let alone atomic details in cellular environments,\\u201d says Zhang.The Yale team\\u2019s feat was made possible by combining the concepts of single-particle analysis cryo-EM and cryo-ET technologies, along with new development of image analysis methodology to analyze high-resolution cellular cryo-EM images at the cryo-ET scale. \\u201cSingle-particle analysis is great for imaging individual molecules, but not for cellular structures,\\u201d Zhang explains. \\u201cCryo-electron tomography is a perfect tool to study cellular structures, but its resolution is typically limited to several nanometers .\\\"They overcame this technical challenge by developing an approach to image cryo-ET targets under single-particle mode, while employing cryo-ET reconstructions as initial references for subsequent single-particle alignment and classification.Another limitation of conventional single-particle cryo-EM is that it typically requires researchers to isolate and purify proteins of interest before freezing and mounting them onto cryo-EM grids, thus removing the molecules from their native environment. This process disrupts weakly assembled higher-order biological complexes, as well as reactions under physiological conditions. This is particularly important in the case of membrane proteins, because purified samples using detergent would completely disrupt the native membrane environment, which is crucial to their normal functions.Previously, our technology was not able to reveal how interactions occur. But in this case, we see the atoms, we see the structures of molecules, and we see how everything interacts.Jack Zhang, PhDBy combining these microscopy approaches and developing novel computational methods, the team was able to create images both at single-particle resolution and at a cryo-ET scale, and then bridge the two using innovative algorithms, allowing researchers to view molecular structures with an unparalleled level of detail. Notably, their technique allowed them, for the first time, to view membrane protein structures within their native mitochondria\\u2014and to view the proteins' natural assembly and function within the whole organelle.Researchers visualize mitochondrial supercomplexes in atomic detailUsing their new microscopy technique, the researchers directly imaged mitochondria from animal heart models to examine mitochondrial respiratory supercomplexes, which are assemblies of proteins living in the organelle\\u2019s inner membrane and playing a vital role in energy production. For the first time, the team was able to view the structures of these supercomplexes in atomic detail without having to isolate them from the mitochondria. It was especially striking that the resolution even allowed for direct observation of individual water molecules associated with these complexes.Because all these supercomplexes were in their native environment, which is distinct from purified proteins, the team was able to visualize the structures of the numerous reactive intermediates while they are functioning within mitochondria at an atomic level. \\u201cUsing anovel classification strategy, we see how proteins are reacting to their environment and captured different intermediate states,\\u201d says Zhang. Conventional approaches only provide location information of molecules or their overall shapes at low resolution in cellular environments. This new approach has substantial pharmaceutical and clinical implications. \\u201cIt can help us study how molecules react to certain drugs in their native cells,\\u201d Zhang says.Paving the way to novel, more effective drug developmentThis microscopy technology could also be groundbreaking in helping researchers understand the underlying mechanisms of various diseases. To explore this further, the Yale team created animal heart models of various states of myocardial ischemia, a cardiovascular condition in which a blockage obstructs blood flow to the heart.They found that the different stages of disease induced significant changes of conformational distribution, and changes in shape, in the supercomplexes along with their native membranes.Experts who reviewed the Zhang team\\u2019s work on behalf ofNaturewrote, \\\"This groundbreaking work sets new standards in structural biology,\\u201d and, \\u201cFuture work will exploit the huge potential of this new approach.\\u201dMoving forward, the Yale team\\u2019s technique can give researchers an entirely new look into what is happening inside normal and diseased cells, which could eventually pave way for the development of highly accurate therapies that target newfound molecular pathways or structures. This is particularly important in the case of membrane proteins, as they are crucial drug targets due to their key roles in physiological and pathological processes, including cell-cell communication, pathogen-host interactions, signal transduction, their accessibility for drugs, high specificity and selectivity, diverse target classes, and significant therapeutic potential.Zhang\\u2019s team is already looking ahead to leading this technology to study various disease models, including animal models and, potentially, donor tissues, to investigate what is happening inside the cells in these different contexts. \\u201cBy expanding our studies to medical applications, we can provide unprecedented detail of what\\u2019s happening in diseased cells so that we can provide better drugs and treatment.\\u201dThis research was funded in part by the National Institutes of Health.\"], [\"How Can Artificial Intelligence Advance Medical Education and Research to Transform Patient Care?\", \"Over the past few years, there has been tremendous advancement in artificial intelligence (AI).

GutGPT uses a specific technique called \\u2018retrieval augmented generation,\\u2019 which gives the generative AI tool trusted information, like clinical guidelines, pathways, and journal articles, that can be cited.During the simulation, participants are asked to treat hypothetical patients with a gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding disorder using synthetic patient data. Each participant is randomly assigned either a dashboard or chatbot interface that allows them to askGutGPT questions to get the information they need quickly. The study aims to measure the usability and trust of the tool compared to other interfaces.\\u201cAsking ChatGPT a question at home is not the same as in a medical setting,\\u201d saidDennis Shung, MD, MHS, PhD, assistantprofessor of medicine (digestive diseases) and director of Applied Artificial Intelligence at the Yale Center for Healthcare Simulation, who is leading the research. \\u201cAt home, you have low stakes and unlimited time. So, we need to test how clinicians will interact with this type of generative AI in a more realistic setting to understand how AI might be most useful in a clinical setting.\\u201dThe research study is bidirectional: students and residents learn how to care for patients with upper GI disorders and the capabilities and limitations of using AI in a clinical setting, while Shung and his team can learn how different team members interact with different types of AI tools.While the study is still in its early stages, Shung says that the simulation center is helping them quickly learn that people use AI differently depending on their roles and experience levels. This information is critical to helping them refine GutGPT so that it can be more useful to each person.\\u201cWe think the biggest value is for residents, who know so much but may need reminders to have confidence in the decisions. We also see value for interdisciplinary teams, since advanced practice providers such as NPs or PAs with a lot of clinical experience are an essential part of health care systems. Having access to a tested, reliable, generative AI team member could help inform their practice,\\u201d said Shung.While some have fears that AI may replace the role of the physician, Shung thinks a well-trained AI tool like GutGPT will only help improve care.\\u201cModern health care has already become a team sport because we recognize that not one person can have all the expertise. AI is just another member of the team with perfect memory who has spent a lot of time looking up a bunch of papers and is now here saying, \\u2018Hey! I\\u2019ve read the guidelines; on page 137, it says to do this,\\u201d said Shung. \\u201cYou are still leading the team. You have to take the expertise from across the team and decide how to use it to make a clinical judgment.\\u201dShung and his team published early results of the study in Machine Learning for Health in 2023 and expect additional publications to follow soon.Improving Health Equity in the Medical School Curriculum with Help from AIKelsey Martin, MD, assistant professor of medicine (hematology) and associate director for medical education atWomen\\u2019s Health Research at Yale,Margaret Pisani, MD, MPH, professor of medicine (pulmonary, critical care, and sleep medicine) andCarolyn M. Mazure, PhD, Norma Weinberg Spungen and Joan Lebson Bildner Professor (women\\u2019s health research) are co-leading anew effortto integrate information about sex, gender, and women\\u2019s health into the medical school curriculum to better teach medical students about how sex and gender impact health and disease.\\u201cHistorically, women were largely excluded as research participants beyond studies related to reproduction, but that is improving and changing. It\\u2019s critical that we bring updated data on the impact of sex and gender on health into medical education and bridge that gap for the next generation of doctors,\\u201d said Martin.Martin and Pisani have started working with faculty members to analyze their existing curriculum and highlight areas for updates. The challenge is that the Yale medical school curriculum is vast, and combing through the syllabi, PowerPoint lectures, clinical case workshops, and other content is time-consuming.\\u201cTime is the biggest constraint to this type of work,\\u201d said Martin. \\u201cIt takes a lot of time to analyze all of this content.\\u201dAt the suggestion of one of their team members,Haleigh Larson, a third-year medical student at Yale, they started usingHumata.aito help cull through the medical curriculum. The research team, which also includesAeka Guru, an undergraduate fellow, developed a question list for input into Humata.ai so it could assess sex and gender content in the curriculum and generate a course report. Questions included: \\u2018Is there any discussion of sex and/or gender in the document?\\u2019 \\u2018What areas could benefit from discussion of sex and gender topics?\\u2019 \\u2018What journals have papers with information on these topics?\\u2019 among others. The Humata.ai tool then performed an initial content analysis to assess sex and gender content in the curriculum and develop suggestions for incorporating new information.Once the AI tool completes its initial analysis, Martin, Pisani, and their project team review and refine the analysis, noting information like when case studies are only focused on males or missing information on patient sex and/or gender, or which topics could enrich educational content, before sharing it with the relevant faculty member.\\u201cUsing AI has made this process faster and more efficient. The feedback we\\u2019ve received so far has been very positive,\\u201d said Martin. \\u201cMany of our faculty have been teaching for a long time, and this allows them to see information in their course in a new light.\\u201d The team is also planning to get feedback from students about the existing curriculum and proposed updates. The curriculum is also a key component of the medical school\\u2019sHealth Equity Thread.After the team finishes combing through the existing curriculum, they plan to develop a tool or a process so that faculty can iteratively update their course content to reflect the latest scientific information.\\u201cScience and medicine are changing so rapidly. As educators, we want to teach our students the most up-to-date knowledge, like how different diseases might manifest differently depending on a person\\u2019s sex or which treatment option might work best for a patient,\\u201d said Pisani. \\u201cWe know that updating case studies and reframing lectures takes time. By making this process more efficient, we hope to break down some of the barriers to curriculum change.\\u201dMartin agrees and says she\\u2019s confident that using AI to assess and update curriculum will help get insights to faculty faster.\\u201cWe\\u2019re lifelong learners in medicine. AI offers another tool we can learn from,\\u201d Martin said. \\u201cWe\\u2019re just beginning to scratch the surface of how AI can be used in other aspects of medical education. There are so many more opportunities for creativity and collaboration.\\u201dScreening the Heart with AIMost cardiologists use technology such as electrocardiograms (ECGs), ultrasounds, or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs) to detect and diagnose heart conditions. While these imaging tools are critical to diagnosing and treating cardiovascular disease, there is a limit to what the human eye can detect.\\u201cWe have a moving, beating heart, and while we can measure and visualize what\\u2019s happening, we can only summarize what we see to a level where we can comprehend,\\u201d saidRohan Khera, MD, MS, assistant professor of medicine (cardiovascular medicine) and director of theCardiovascular Data Science (CarDS) Lab. \\u201cAI can look at the same video and learn what\\u2019s happening from frame to frame and beat to beat to help us understand the small and long-term changes that happen over the full cardiac cycle.\\u201dKhera and his colleagues at the lab are working to harness the power of AI to develop state-of-the-art models that can help detect cardiovascular diseases through common imaging modalities. They recentlypublished a paperidentifying an AI-based biomarker to diagnose aortic stenosis, a common valve disorder affecting more than 2.5 million people in the United States alone. They\\u2019ve also identified an AI-based approach that would allow for the automated screening of left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) from ECG images. Currently, screening for LVSD is often unavailable or reserved for people with symptomatic disease. The work extends beyond diagnostics to defining precise and personalized care for patients with cardiovascular disease through AI deployed to clinical trials and wearable devices.\\u201cThere is so much possibility in automating the interpretation of imaging tests to detect and diagnose some of the most common heart conditions,\\u201d said Khera. \\u201cWe see the opportunity for AI to help us diagnose these diseases earlier so that patients can start treatment sooner and reduce their risk of severe complications from their disease.\\u201dWhile these tools are not yet integrated into clinical practice, Khera is optimistic that they will one day expand access to the highest-level cardiology care for patients, especially those in low-resource settings.\\u201cNot every clinician has access to hundreds of expert cardiologists that they can consult to help read a complicated ECG,\\u201d said Khera. \\u201cAnd yet, they must still treat the patient in front of them. AI can help give clinicians a better view of the heart and help expand our capacity to deliver expert-level care in settings where it was not physically possible before.\\u201dUsing AI to Annotate a Vast Hematology Tissue BankTheYale Hematology Tissue Bankgives researchers access to critical patient samples for the study of hematologic diseases. The repository continues to grow exponentially and now has more than 3,300 patients enrolled and close to 9,000 individual samples, including blood, bone marrow biopsies, lymph nodes, saliva, pericardial fluid, and other various tissue biopsies.Each sample has been painstakingly annotated with rich clinical data. However, manual abstraction of the clinical record has been inefficient, limiting the value of the samples to researchers. Applying traditional national language processing methods for automated information extraction was not completely useful, as the technology could not fully contextualize language or generate human-like languages.\\u201cClinical research, clinical trials, and predictive algorithms all depend on digitized and structured data so that researchers can perform the analysis required to better understand and treat blood disorders,\\u201d saidStephanie Halene, MD, Dr Med, Arthur H. and Isabel Bunker Professor of Hematology, and chief of Yale Hematology. \\u201cWe have all of this incredibly rich clinical data in the Hematology Tissue Bank, but we had not found a way to extract the information in a way that was efficient and accurate.\\u201dHalene and her team reached out toWade Schulz, MD, PhD, assistant professor (laboratory medicine) and director of the CORE Center for Computational Health, who worked with them to build a hematology-specific large language model, a form of generative AI, behind a secure firewall to safeguard all data. Their goal is to ultimately annotate the entire tissue bank and build a hematology research database that researchers can search using natural language questions.While they\\u2019re still in the early stages of the project, Halene is encouraged by the potential for this tool to more accurately and efficiently extract the data that researchers need for their work.\\u201cWe see this AI tool as an opportunity to enhance the value of our repository for researchers so that they have quicker access to the detailed information they need to determine if a particular sample is appropriate to their research,\\u201d Halene said. \\u201cUltimately, we hope it will help us meet our mission to spur biomedical research to improve the care for patients with blood disorders.\\u201dThe Department of Internal Medicine at Yale is among the nation's premier departments, bringing together an elite cadre of clinicians, investigators, educators, and staff in one of the world's top medical schools.

Fuctito is associate professor of psychiatry at Yale School of Medicine.Benjamin Toll, PhD, director of the Tobacco Treatment Program at MUSC Health, adjunct professor of psychiatry at Yale School of Medicine, and senior author on the study, said the researchers designed the trial to mimic real-world conditions as much as possible \\u2013 from the people who enrolled in the trial to the type of support they would likely receive from primary care providers.The publication of their results closely follows publication of a trial of cytisinicline for e-cigarette cessation. The two drugs work similarly. However, varenicline is already on the market in the U.S. in generic versions while cytisinicline has not yet received FDA approval and is not currently available for use by patients.Varenicline, perhaps better known by the brand name Chantix, is FDA-approved to help adults to stop smoking traditional cigarettes. But, despite the growing numbers of people who use e-cigarettes, there are no approved medication options to help them to stop using e-cigarettes.\\u201cPeople can get to very high levels of nicotine exposure with these e-cigarette products, and they can use them near constantly throughout the day. So, the question we all have is, \\u2018Can any pharmacotherapy stand up to this challenge?\\u2019\\u201d Fucito said.It\\u2019s a question of logistics. People who smoke cigarettes have to get a cigarette from the pack and light it. It\\u2019s easy to track use. There are also natural stopping points \\u2013 when the cigarette is finished, it must be snuffed out, and when the pack is used up, it must be thrown away and a new one purchased and opened before the person can smoke again.E-cigarettes, however, can last for 5,000 or more puffs, making them harder to track in terms of intake but easier to use. Toll said he has patients who describe keeping their e-cigarettes under their pillows so they can vape right before going to sleep and then again immediately upon waking in the morning.Previous studies have shown that a majority of people using e-cigarettes want to quit. But it\\u2019s been unclear whether products used to stop smoking traditional combustible cigarettes would also work for e-cigarettes.\\u201cWe need more pharmacotherapy treatments to help address the really strong physical dependence that can develop from e-cigarette use,\\\" Fucito said. \\\"People undergo significant withdrawal when they try to stop, and that withdrawal is so unpleasant and hard to manage with just behavioral support alone.\\\"A recent Italian study married pharmacotherapy with intense weekly behavioral counseling sessions, and the trial of cytisinicline also included weekly 10-minute sessions with trained counselors.In this study, however, the researchers wanted to see how well the pharmacotherapy could work given typical health care conditions \\u2013 meaning, the patient would likely get a brief discussion with a primary care provider along with a prescription and information about resources for quitting but no follow-up counseling sessions.To recreate this, they developed a self-guided cessation booklet for patients, with practical tools and tips for quitting. A licensed health care provider also met with each patient to inform them of how to use the medication, offer brief advice and instruct them to set a quit date for one to two weeks after starting the medication.\\u201cWe took a much lighter touch to reflect the behavioral support that you\\u2019d likely experience if you went to your doctor and asked for help with quitting e-cigarettes,\\u201d Fucito said.The study also included some patients with histories of depression. This was significant because Chantix, at one point, had a \\u201cblack box warning\\u201d after reports linking the drug to psychiatric side effects. That warning was dropped in 2016 after a very large study showed the drug to be safe, but Toll and Fucito said the stigma of the warning remains in the minds of both health care providers and the general public.\\u201cThere\\u2019s still some hesitancy to prescribe this very safe \\u2013 now generic \\u2013 drug, and it really shouldn't be that way,\\u201d Toll said.None of the participants in this study experienced serious side effects, although a larger study would be needed to verify this finding. Most of the side effects were along the lines of nausea, insomnia or vivid dreams.Another piece of good news \\u2013 those who stopped vaping didn\\u2019t boomerang back to cigarettes.\\u201cIf you have a former smoking history, one of the worries in the field is that you\\u2019re going to go back to smoking when you quit vaping,\\u201d Toll said. \\u201cAnd we did not find that.\\u201dOn the other hand, one potential challenge that the researchers uncovered in the results indicated that people without a cigarette smoking history \\u2013 in other words, those who have only ever used e-cigarettes \\u2013 might have a harder time quitting. That could be because that group is more likely to use e-cigarettes continuously throughout the day, therefore getting more nicotine into their systems.Larger trials are needed to delve into these questions. But this trial, at least, should give health care providers some confidence in prescribing varenicline for patients trying to stop using e-cigarettes.\\u201cWe want people to come back to this medication,\\u201d Fucito said. \\u201cThere are people who need help now and are likely to struggle to quit e-cigarettes on their own because the technology facilitates nicotine use on a level that we\\u2019ve never seen before.\\u201d\"], [\"Stem Cell Research Uncovers Clues to Tissue Repair That Could Help Heal the Uterus and More\", \"Stem cells play a vital role in repairing damaged tissue, whether it\\u2019s a scraped knee or a scarred uterus following pregnancy. New stem cell research has identified the molecules that the cells produce to promote the healing process. The finding could pave the way for the development of new, more effective drugs for injuries or various diseases, including conditions related to reproductive health such as Asherman syndrome, a gynecologic condition in which the uterus scars and becomes fibrotic.Scientists believed in the past that stem cells served as backup cells that repaired tissues by differentiating into new cells that repopulated the site of injury. Now, they have learned that it is rare for stem cells to completely replace injured tissue. But they still don\\u2019t fully understand how the cells are able to help damaged areas regenerate.We found the molecules that stem cells make to help heal and repair tissue, and we hope that understanding this will be potentially useful as a medication in the future.Hugh Taylor, MDIn the uterus, stem cells play a number of roles, including helping it to expand during pregnancy and to regenerate and repair after childbirth. This new study identified several microRNAs (miRNAs) secreted by the stem cells that helped drive the growth and proliferation of cells in uterine tissue. The researchers published their findings inStem Cell Research& Therapyon May 1.\\u201cWe found the molecules that stem cells make to help heal and repair tissue, and we hope that understanding this will be potentially useful as a medication in the future,\\u201d saysHugh Taylor, MD, chair and Anita O\\u2019Keeffe Young Professor of Obstetrics, Gynecology & Reproductive Sciences at Yale School of Medicine and the study\\u2019s principal investigator.Stem cells secrete miRNAs that support cell proliferationExosomes are extracellular vesicles, which contain various bioactive molecules and allow cells to communicate with one another. In their new study, Taylor\\u2019s team isolated exosomes secreted by stem cells from human bone marrow. They then used RNA sequencing to characterize all of the miRNA contained in the vesicles and identified those that were most abundant. Then researchers took the most prominent miRNAs and introduced them into human uterine tissue.The team found that the miRNAs significantly increased the growth and proliferation of the uterine cells. They also studied their effect on the cells\\u2019 decidualization in the endometrium. (Decidualization is the differentiation process uterine cells undergo that prepares the uterus to support an embryo.) The study showed that the miRNAs blocked decidualization.\\u201cIn a uterus, once a cell becomes differentiated to support pregnancy, it can no longer repair and regenerate. It\\u2019s permanently locked in that state and often is shed through menstruation later on,\\u201d says Taylor. \\u201cBy blocking this process, it allows the cells to focus on proliferating and turns on these reparative processes.\\u201dTurning miRNAs into drugs for tissue repairThe study offers insight into how stem cells promote reparative processes without replacing the tissue itself. Taylor hopes that as researchers continue to gain a greater understanding about how miRNAs work, they could one day be used as drugs for repairing various damaged tissue.Asherman syndrome, for example, typically occurs after pregnancy, when the supply of stem cells may not be adequate to help the organ heal properly, which can hinder fertility in the future. \\u201cThe idea is that these miRNAs could be used as a medication that is much more readily available and practical,\\u201d says Taylor. \\u201cWe could potentially deliver them to help prepare the uterus in the critical window when it is damaged and may be vulnerable.\\u201dThe finding could also have significance beyond the uterus. In future stem cell research, Taylor\\u2019s team plans to study how miRNAs respond to other types of traumatic tissue injury in animal models. \\u201cWe studied the uterus, but the implications are beyond reproduction, potentially including many other conditions where stem cells are involved in repair and regeneration, whether that\\u2019s injury due to trauma or degenerative diseases,\\u201d says Taylor.This research was funded by the National Institutes of Health.\"], [\"Yale Begins 3D Orthopaedic Surgical Procedures That Are Fully In-house\", \"Lisa Lattanza, MD, chair and Ensign Professor of Orthopaedics & Rehabilitation, has performed the first fully in-house 3D surgical case at Yale.Lattanzaperformed the world\\u2019s first elbow transplantprior tojoining Yale School of Medicine as chair in 2019. She has long maintained ambitious goals for melding her world-renowned expertise in 3D surgical planning with emerging innovations in 3D technology to establish Yale as a destination for orthopaedic care.The first in-house, custom, personalized 3D surgical procedure repaired a distal radius malunion, which is caused when a broken forearm heals incorrectly, resulting in misaligned or deformed bones. Lattanza worked alongside a Yale team to develop a 3D surgical plan for the patient, 3D printed personalized surgical guides, and 3D printed anatomically precise models of the bone structure. By using advanced imaging software with 3D modeling and printing, Lattanza was able to identify the best outcomes possible through a non-standardized surgical approach without having to make an incision. This latest endeavor represents the ever-converging synergy between orthopaedics and engineering, and also is creating new opportunities in personalized medicine.Visualizing orthopaedics in 3D\\u201cOrthopaedic surgery is geared toward functionality and returning patients to normal life, and to that end, \\u2018one size fits all\\u2019 is no longer a phrase that applies for us,\\u201d Lattanza said. \\u201cOur priority is to fully understand each patient and develop a plan of care based on their specific needs, long-term goals, and achievable outcomes. Since every person has a unique anatomy with individualized motion patterns and functions, as well as unique injuries, 3D surgical procedures are tailored specifically for each patient.\\u201dSurgeons are often tasked with reviewing two-dimensional images such as X-rays, which leave considerable room for interpretation as it relates to the degree and direction of deformity. Innovations in 3D surgical planning are allowing surgeons such as Lattanza to provide unmatched care to patients who have been suffering from injuries or congenital problems that did not heal appropriately, leading to pain and musculoskeletal dysfunction.Using specialized software, engineers can convert images from CT or MRI scans into 3D digital anatomy. Surgeons can plan their surgery using these digital models prior to making a cut, making the operation safer and more efficient. While this technology is a game-changer, the surgeon still needs to rely on their training and expertise to effectively execute the plan. This technology can also be vital in repairing previous surgeries that did not solve the patient's problem.The detailed digital models enable surgeons to identify various conditions by categorizing them into types and subsets, allowing for a much more accurate surgical intervention. By using this 3D technology in advance of pediatric, adult, musculoskeletal oncology, and other cases, the surgery can be optimized to the best possible outcome.Planning surgeries using 3D computer modeling before even entering the operating room is a tremendous benefit for physicians and enables surgeons to comprehensively understand every case so they can plan which approach or permutation of each procedure is most appropriate. In some cases, new approaches and techniques are used based on information learned from the planning.3D printing for orthopaedic surgeryIn addition to 3D planning, Yale surgeons, clinicians, and researchers can now utilize the3D Collaborative for Medical Innovation(3DC), which is based in the Department of Orthopaedics & Rehabilitation, to create 3D printed patient-specific models and tools. These precise anatomical prints allow surgeons to physically manipulate the exact portions of bone they will see in the operating room and offer a tactile reference for how surgical guides and jigs will fit beforehand, which can be extraordinarily helpful in complex deformity cases.3DC Program Director and Lead Engineer Alyssa Glennon has spent more than the past decade working with some of the world\\u2019s preeminent orthopaedic surgeons to create 3D virtual surgical plans and patient-specific instrumentation for use in surgery for both upper and lower extremities. She explained more about how this new initiative is bringing advanced 3D technologies to Yale.\\u201cOur primary objective is to support our clinicians and their cases by bringing engineering expertise into their surgical planning, and technology like 3D printing, artificial intelligence, and virtual reality into the operating room,\\u201d Glennon said. \\u201cWith our in-house 3DC team, we offer patient-specific solutions wherever and whenever needed. This leads to benefits such as reduced operating times, reduced intra-operative fluoroscopy, enhanced precision, improved consistency, minimized complications, lowered costs to the hospital, and better patient outcomes, among others.\\u201dYale surgeons have typically worked with third parties in the past to design surgical plans or custom-print components to be used in surgery based on a patient\\u2019s unique anatomy. This would often be limited, however, by patient pathology, challenging timelines, and requirements for more complicated communication and delivery pathways. The goal of the 3DC is to offer those same services, and more, right here at Yale.\\u201cWith an in-house lab, we have many more options,\\u201d Glennon added. \\u201cBecause the 3DC is within Yale School of Medicine, we are adjacent to the physicians and the operating rooms. We can make rapid changes based on real-time feedback from the clinicians, and we can work with faster lead times since no shipment is required. We can also support more pathology types and patient age brackets, circumventing any limitations of third parties. We can have engineering staff present in the operating room at the time of surgery, or we are just a short walk away.\\u201dThe first in-house 3D surgical caseThe patient who underwent Lattanza\\u2019s first procedure had an injury to the forearm leading to functional impairment of the wrist, loss of strength, a reduced range of motion, pain, and cosmetic concerns. Malunions typically occur because of inadequate immobilization, poor fracture reduction, or underlying medical conditions that impact the process of healing bone.The most common surgical procedure to repair a malunion is called an osteotomy. During the operation, a surgeon will cut the affected bones and move them into a better position and hold them in place with a plate and screws intended to keep the forearm stable while it heals. In the past, these cases were corrected \\u201cfreehand\\u201d using the surgeon\\u2019s best judgment and X-rays to reposition the bone. However, realigning in all three planes of the deformity is not possible based on X-rays alone. Now, with the use of 3D planning, the deformity and anatomy can be corrected back to exactly how they were before the injury.To accomplish this, the engineer and surgeon collaborate to review the case and plan together on the computer. This process involves using the patient\\u2019s unique anatomy from CT imagery. The mirrored, healthy arm is overlaid on top of the surgical side to comprehensively analyze the deformity and compare it to the healthy anatomy.The surgeon focuses on anatomy, understanding of function, and what must be corrected, as well as a surgical approach and the hardware involved. The engineer does the processing of the CT or MRI, plus the 3D analysis, and recommends an osteotomy type and location to correct the deformity, and also virtually simulates the osteotomy and hardware placement for approval by the surgeon.For this first case, Lattanza and Glennon discussed the possible correction strategies and collaborated to finalize the custom pre-surgical plan. Glennon then designed and 3D-printed patient-specific jigs and surgical guides and created 3D-printed anatomical models of the patient\\u2019s arm bones, which Lattanza was able to further examine, manipulate, and refer to during surgery.Surgery was performed in April. First the radius, which is the forearm bone that runs from the thumb side of the wrist to the elbow, was corrected and plated based on the plan, and then the ulna \\u2014 the other long forearm bone \\u2014 was adjusted to make sure the wrist joint was fully restored.3D applications beyond orthopaedicsWhile the 3DC specializes in supporting clinical cases, engineers like Glennon can collaborate on other projects in medicine. Engineering services of the 3DC include medical imaging data segmentation, the creation and/or modification of digital anatomical models and 3D analysis of such models, computer aided design (CAD) of medical devices and/or test devices, preparation and/or deployment of 3D digital models into extended reality, 3D printing, and other similar tasks.\\u201cWe want to offer the best patient experience possible through the 3DC, while enabling surgeons to achieve what seems impossible,\\u201d Glennon said. \\u201cWith technology constantly evolving, we are in a unique position to help clinicians rapidly adapt so everyone benefits \\u2014most important, the patients.\\u201d\\u201cSurgeons are like race car drivers, steering the case and driving the surgery to the finish line for the patient,\\u201d Glennon added. \\u201cWinning a race, though, requires support to empower the drivers to do what they do best. Engineering is part of the pit crew for the healthcare team.\\u201d\\u201cWe help physicians visualize pathology, offer new perspectives and in-depth analysis on surgical plans, streamline surgery to ensure operations run smoothly, and innovate on medical devices to improve the experiences for both the surgeons and their patients,\\u201d she continued. \\u201cWe recognize that every single body is different and, by bringing technology like this into the hospital, it equips our health care teams with what they need to customize every case to best fit the individual.\\u201dTo date, the 3DC has supported five orthopaedic surgical cases involving both upper and lower extremities. Glennon is also in discussions with plastic surgery, radiation oncology, and other departments about the many opportunities to bring engineering and technology to support surgeon effectiveness and patient care.Personalized medical education is a new frontierDriven by rapid technological advancements in 3D printing and advanced imaging visualization techniques, personalized patient care is quickly becoming mainstream in medicine. Dedicated in-house engineering services can reduce production times, support unique innovation initiatives, and reduce the overall costs for health systems.There are also untold uses for training sessions, educational opportunities, and further convergence with artificial intelligence and augmented reality to continue to develop the skillsets of both emerging and experienced surgeons.Although this surgical case represents a first of its kind at Yale, work has been well underway to develop this niche of medical engineering professionals capable of supporting health care systems. Through a collaboration between Yale School of Medicine, the Yale School of Engineering & Applied Sciences, and the Department of Orthopaedics & Rehabilitation, Yale created thenation\\u2019s first master\\u2019s degree in personalized medicine and applied engineeringin 2022, conceived by Lattanza and Glennon with the collaboration and hard work of Daniel Wiznia, MD, associate professor of orthopaedics & rehabilitation, and Steven Tommassini, PhD, a research scientist in the department.The one-year advanced degree program istraining the next generation of engineers, computer scientists, and medical professionalsin using new technologies in 3D medicine and imaging. As it enters its third academic year this fall, dozens of students have learned how to develop and apply 3D technology to address surgical and medical conditions, with the goal of personalizing healthcare treatments to improve clinical outcomes.\\u201cThis technology allows us to treat every patient as an individual to formulate a treatment plan, whether it\\u2019s a surgical plan or a medical plan that is devised specifically for that individual rather than something that is more broad or general,\\u201d Lattanza said. \\u201cIt is also a powerful learning and research tool that is breaking down assumptions that we have made about various orthopaedic problems when we could only see and study them in two dimensions.\\\"\\u201cThere are multiple ways that this is going to impact patient care, whether it\\u2019s from the 3D cellular printing aspect or the individualized surgery. It also could lead to projects that would involve better ways of educating students coming through either the medical school side or the engineering side in terms of accessing three-dimensional anatomy.\\u201d\"], [\"Investigating the Link Between Metabolism and Cancer\", \"WhenRachel Perry, PhD, assistant professor of medicine (endocrinology) and of cellular and molecular physiology, started her lab in 2018, she set out to understand how the tools used to study systemic metabolism could be applied in the context of cancer.\\u201cWe\\u2019re looking at how can we change the nutrients that we take in and the energy that we put out,\\u201d Perry explained. \\u201cFor instance, we want to find out how can we alter exercise or other behavior to improve our body's metabolic or nutritional response to cancer.\\u201dIn an interview, Perry discusses the link between insulin and cancer, a surprising finding in her research, and the future of precision medicine for metabolism-related cancers.What metabolic factors drive tumor growth?Cancer cells divide quickly, and to grow, tumors require many nutrients. One of the major nutrients for tumors is glucose. Research has shown that insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas, is key to regulating glucose uptake into tumors. Insulin tells various cells in the body to take up glucose in response to a meal to use for energy.Individuals with obesity tend to be insulin resistant, meaning their cells don\\u2019t take up glucose in response to insulin. When that occurs, our bodies produce more insulin to allow us to overcome that insulin resistance. Insulin is both a growth factor and a metabolic factor in cells. Insulin tells tumor cells to take up glucose like it tells liver and muscle cells to take up glucose.The problem is tumor cells do not become insulin resistant, whereas other cells in the body do. In an individual with obesity and insulin resistance, tumor cells continue to take up more glucose in response to insulin, but the other cells in the body do not. When insulin levels are high, and other cells aren't responding, more glucose is funneled into tumor cells.Are there ways to reduce the risk of developing this type of cancer?Numerous studies have shown that low-carbohydrate diets and exercise can be beneficial.Have you found anything surprising in your research?We did a study in preclinical models in which we combined a drug called dichloroacetate, which can activate glucose oxidation, with immunotherapy. We thought that if you activate glucose metabolism, it could improve the response to immunotherapy. The drug didn't slow tumor growth, but it did reduce cancer-related fatigue.We weren\\u2019t expecting to go in the direction of cancer-related fatigue, but my philosophy in the lab is we follow the science. Ninety percent of patients with cancer report substantial fatigue that impairs their quality of life and reduces the probability that they will complete cancer treatment. Currently, there are no effective medications for this debilitating condition. We hope that this drug can potentially help these patients.What is the future of treatment for metabolism-related cancers?There are 13 tumor types that the CDC has associated with obesity. But there are also people with a BMI under 30 who have metabolic dysfunction, and there are people with a BMI over 30 who do not have metabolic dysfunction. One key thing that we need to do is nuance our understanding of what obesity means and link tumor factors to metabolic dysfunction rather than BMI.We are working to learn more about how systemic metabolism affects the immune response to cancer and the tumor's metabolic response to cancer. We hope to repurpose metabolic drugs used for diabetes or obesity to potentially improve cancer treatment.We showed in a paper published a couple of years ago that in various breast cancer preclinical models, depending on the tumor genetics, different models respond better to insulin-lowering therapies. That research opens the possibility of developing precision medicine-type approaches to use metabolic therapy for cancer. That\\u2019s our goal moving on.Yale School of Medicine\\u2019sSection of Endocrinology and Metabolism works to improve the health of individuals with endocrine and metabolic diseases by advancing scientific knowledge, applying new information to patient care, and training the next generation of physicians and scientists to become leaders in the field.

For those living with Long COVID, debilitating symptoms can make traveling to a study site impossible.Now,Harlan Krumholz, MD, Harold H. Hines, Jr. Professor of Medicine (Cardiology), is pioneering a new approach that makes participation in clinical research accessible for those whose lives have been upended by the post-acute infection syndrome. At Yale School of Medicine, working closely with Sterling ProfessorAkiko Iwasaki, PhD, he is the principal investigator of theYale Paxlovid for Long COVID (PAX LC) Trial, a phase 2 investigational new drug clinical trial evaluating the use of the antiviral for people with Long COVID with a decentralized nationwide design that brings the research into participants\\u2019 homes. Operating throughout the contiguous United States, it is the first fully decentralized phase 2 trial with this complexity and scale.Krumholz believes that this trial demonstrates that a future of clinical research that allows patients to participate at their convenience is not only possible, but more efficient and even cost-effective than standard clinical trials.For example, April 9 marked Cindy\\u2019s* fourth anniversary of living with Long COVID.It started with severe fatigue that made her feel as if her limbs \\u201cweighed a million pounds,\\u201d followed by shortness of breath and gastrointestinal issues after she was infected with COVID-19 in 2020. Her symptoms never went away. A single mom in Texas with a 6-year-old son, she says the disease forced her to get creative: She made up a game where he rolled a ball around her while she lay still on their trampoline.Over the years, her symptoms have ebbed and flowed. She suffered a sharp decline in January 2022 \\u2014 the height of the Omicron wave \\u2014 when she was hit with her second acute COVID  infection. This triggered the start of a slow decline that eventually took a toll on her cognitive abilities, hindering her ability to perform her job as an aerospace engineer and eventually forcing her to take a leave of absence in the fall of 2023. This was also when she began experiencing another common Long COVID symptom known as post-exertional malaise (PEM), in which her symptoms significantly worsened after physical or mental activity, sometimes leaving her bedbound for days at a time.\\u201cI was known for thinking outside of the box, being able to juggle things, look to the future, and solve problems. I knew how to put big, complicated puzzles together,\\u201d she says. \\u201cSuddenly, everything seemed so complicated. Living became so hard. I was just trying to survive day-by-day, if not hour-by-hour, managing all of my symptoms.\\u201dDesperate for answers, Cindy stayed on top of ongoing clinical trials. Last year, she applied for a stem cell therapy trial in Houston but was eliminated as a potential participant during the final screening. On the one hand, she was devastated. \\u201cI was absolutely convinced that the therapy was going to be the answer for me,\\u201d she says.But enrolling in the trial would have presented its own challenges. She lives 45 minutes away from Houston and would have needed help getting rides. And she wondered if she had the capacity to be able to participate in all that the trial required. \\u201cFrom an accessibility standpoint, most clinical trials require you to be there in person for exams, bloodwork, tests, or whatever else they need,\\u201d she says. \\u201cThat\\u2019s just not feasible when you have a limiting condition.\\u201dThen, she came across that the PAX LC Trial. Typically, participating in a clinical trial with a Connecticut-based university would have been impossible. But the YSM team was prepared to bring the study to patients no matter where they lived in the U.S. Participants received the drug or placebo in their mailboxes and filled out electronic diaries. They gave blood and saliva samples at home or at a nearby lab. \\u201cThe Pax LC trial is a historic contribution to the evolution of a new way of doing trials,\\u201d Krumholz says. \\u201cI\\u2019m really proud of what we\\u2019ve accomplished, and I\\u2019m hoping it will be a spark for the future.\\u201dSlow enrollment of clinical trials hinders scientific progressResearchers currently haveseveral hypothesesfor the underlying causes of Long COVID, including persistent virus, lingering SARS-CoV-2 viral remnants, autoimmune dysfunction, reactivated latent viruses like Epstein-Barr, and tissue damage. These hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, and it is possible that individuals with Long COVID may experience a combination of these mechanisms. Krumholz, Iwasaki, and their team designed the Pax LC Trial to test the persistent virus hypothesis.Cindy initiated the prescreening process by filling out by a survey about pre-existing conditions and syncing her medical records to an app on her phone. Several months later, she received an email inviting her to move forward. The next steps of the prescreening involved going to a local medical laboratory to give blood samples, as well as adjusting some of her medications.Once enrolled, Cindy received her course of either Paxlovid or a placebo by mail. Each night, she answered survey questions about her symptoms from her phone. She also gave blood and saliva samples five times. Three of these times, the Pax LC team sent a technician to her home. \\u201cTo be able to have somebody come to your house \\u2014 that just made life so much easier,\\u201d she says. For the other two sample collection dates, she went to a nearby laboratory.Despite the fact that our trial is sort of built as a concierge service for each individual patient, it was much less expensive than what we had been doing.Harlan Krumholz, MDPatients aren\\u2019t the only ones who can benefit from decentralized trials, says Krumholz. For over a decade, he has been an advocate for reforming clinical research, arguing that its current structure stymies innovation. His colleagues in the laboratory are discovering potential avenues to treating diseases at a \\u201cdizzying pace,\\u201d he says. However, because standard clinical trials struggle to recruit and keep patients, they have not been able to keep up with the pace of scientific discovery, which prevents new drugs and medical devices from reaching the market.\\u201cWe\\u2019re in the midst of a life sciences revolution,\\u201d says Krumholz. \\u201cThe central chokepoint is evidence generation \\u2014 cycle times are too slow, and trials are so expensive that our level of confidence has to be very high, or no one will make the investment.\\u201dThis is because for many, the ability to participate in clinical trials and conform to the schedule they demand is a luxury. Not only does this slow enrollment, but it also contributes to the stark lack of diversity in research. \\u201cThe current way of doing things is often leaving us in a position where we are having to chase participants and cajole them to stay in the studies that were built for their benefit,\\u201d says Krumholz. \\u201cImagine how off-putting clinical trials must be when people who have the most to gain are left in the position where they don\\u2019t want to continue.\\u201dThe solution, he proposes, is creating clinical trials, modeled after PAX LC, that treat participants as partners and accommodate their constraints. PAX LC not only conformed to participants\\u2019 schedules, but also strived to create a sense of community through running virtual town halls for people with long COVID so they could ask questions and stay updated on results as researchers got them. \\u201cPeople don\\u2019t have any obligation to join trials, so we need to make it so they\\u2019re something they want to join,\\u201d he says.Bringing clinical trials into patients\\u2019 homesEzra,* a freelance cartoonist in Minnesota, began experiencing COVID-19 symptoms in September 2022 and never recovered. At the time, he suffered PEM so severe that exertion as small as \\u201cmicrowaving lunch\\u201d could put him in bed for days. He saw doctor after doctor at his nearby hospital, and when that failed, he decided to try traveling to the Mayo Clinic. \\u201cI feel very fortunate that I was able to get somewhere like Mayo a few times, but it is an hour and a half drive from Minneapolis,\\u201d he says. \\u201cIt cost my partner gas money and lost time at work [to take me there].\\u201dIn his search for answers, he learned of the Pax LC Trial and decided to enroll. \\u201cThe effort to bring the trial into people\\u2019s houses is valiant, especially for a population that is chronically ill,\\u201d he says. \\u201cFor disabled people to become a part of clinical trials already requires so much of us\\u2014even those of us who have support systems that are able to take care of us. Adding an extra thing to our plates is often just not feasible for most people with chronic illness.\\u201dOther Pax LC Trial participants echo Ezra\\u2019s sentiments. \\u201cEarly on [in my illness], there was no way I could have traveled on my own [to a clinical trial]. It would have taken everything out of me,\\u201d says Kyle*, a Vermont filmmaker who has been living with Long COVID since April 2022. While the launch of the ambitious clinical trial was not without its kinks \\u2014 Kyle and others say they experienced scheduling delays, such as receiving the drug/placebo or payments late, that prolonged the process \\u2014 he says that PAX LC has opened a window for him that otherwise would have been unavailable. \\u201cIt was nice the trial tried to make it work for people, understanding that part of our illness is incapacity.\\u201dThe PAX LC Trial was largely made possible by the Yale Center for Clinical Investigation team, with Yashira Henriquez, the clinical investigation project manager, who is based in New York, playing a central role. Her daily activities included monitoring participants\\u2019 surveys and checking in on anyone who had reported adverse events. \\u201cSince there are no study visits, we texted or called each other all the time,\\u201d she says. The most common adverse event was dysgeusia, or a metallic taste in the mouth, which has been a common complaint among patients with acute COVID who have received the drug. \\u201cIn this type of trial where you never meet someone face-to-face, you need to show even more compassion to make them feel at ease.\\u201dIn previous roles, Henriquez had worked on studies evaluating treatment for acute COVID-19 infections but wasn\\u2019t as familiar with Long COVID. Her experience working for the PAX LC Trial has opened her eyes to the dire need for more research in treatments for the chronic condition.\\u201cI\\u2019ve worked on clinical trials in numerous positions, but this is one where patients are especially in desperate need to find answers,\\u201d she says. She recalls an hour-long phone conversation she had with a participant who was struggling with depression and becoming a stay-at-home mom after Long COVID forced her to leave her job. \\u201cIt\\u2019s hard to see people who were living a healthy life end up in a state where they\\u2019re now debilitated and can\\u2019t even get out of bed.\\u201dMost participants she worked with responded well to the design of the trial, she adds. Their cooperation allowed the study to run smoothly despite many of them being states away. \\u201cWe didn\\u2019t have to bother them to do the surveys or get their study visits done,\\u201d Henriquez says, \\u201cbecause they all wanted to help.\\u201dNew technologies make cost-effective decentralized trials possibleThe \\u201crecord rate\\u201d of enrollment speaks to the success of PAX LC Trial\\u2019s design. It can take years for clinical trials to finish the enrollment period. PAX LC finished in under a year. Although it is a small trial of 100 participants, given its numerous restrictions around eligibility to participate and requirements for collecting blood and saliva specimens for Iwasaki\\u2019s lab, enrollment would have taken significantly longer without its decentralized format, Krumholz says.Previously, a trial like this was not practical. But now, the evolution of new technologies is making the possibility of decentralized trials more accessible than ever. Recently, for example, Krumholz co-founded Hugo Health, a platform that enables people to transfer their medical records more seamlessly, with their permission, to researchers. \\u201cBecause of the 21stcentury Cures Act [a 2016 lawcreated to advance medical product innovation], people can get access to their medical records and share them with trusted partners,\\u201d he says. \\u201cNow we don\\u2019t have to go through a Byzantine set of obstacles through a particular health system to access a patient\\u2019s medical data \\u2013 we just need to work in partnership with participants.\\u201dTraveling to each participant\\u2019s home would seem to be a pricey endeavor. But given its greater efficiency, the design of the PAX LC Trial has actually cut down on costs, Krumholz argues. If it had been run like a standard clinical trial, his team would have had to set up study sites across the country. The associated costs would have been extremely high; also, the complexities involved in a multitude of institutional review boards (IRBs) whose approval would be needed, would have significantly slowed the study\\u2019s progress.  Furthermore, many clinical trials need to extend their study periods as they struggle to retain participants, which also adds to the costs.\\u201cDespite the fact that our trial is sort of built as a concierge service for each individual patient, it was much less expensive than what we had been doing,\\u201d Krumholz says. \\u201cWhat I hope will happen is that it will be a competitive advantage to do decentralized trials.\\u201dDecentralized clinical trials can be applied to a multitude of fieldsAbout a month into the PAX LC Trial, Ezra noticed that his symptoms had dramatically declined. He still doesn\\u2019t know if he had taken the drug or the placebo, but \\u201cthe brain fog is gone, the memory issues are gone, the cognitive problems seem to have pretty much evaporated,\\u201d he says. He can take a 45-minute walk again and was able to return to work. He is not cured, however. He still has symptoms of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) [a disorder in which standing up triggers symptoms such as rapid heart rate] and gets winded easily.Unfortunately, for many people with Long COVID, there won\\u2019t be a magic pill that restores them to normal. More clinical trials aimed at other possible underlying mechanisms of Long COVID, such as autoimmune dysfunction, will be needed. And these patients, many of whom are struggling to work and provide for their families, don\\u2019t have years to wait. Decentralized trials could help bring much-needed answers more quickly.And this type of trial doesn\\u2019t need to be confined to Long COVID. \\u201cI\\u2019m confident the way we set this up can work with almost any population,\\u201d says Krumholz. He is optimistic that if PAX LC will inspire other researchers to adopt a more participant-centric format for different kinds of research.\\u201cOur trial is like Kitty Hawk [the Wright Flyer], we just needed to show that it could fly,\\u201d he says. \\u201cThe hope is that soon there will be fleets of planes that adopt this approach.\\u201d\"], [\"Beyond Weight Loss: Five Yale Experts on the Benefits of Exercise\", \"Most of us know that regular physical activity can strengthen muscles, burn fat, and lower our risk of heart disease. But many advantages of exercise go beyond physical fitness and cardiovascular health, according to Yale School of Medicine experts.Five Yale Department of Internal Medicine specialists in areas ranging from infectious diseases to allergy and immunology discuss why exercise is key to optimal health.1.Exercise reverses insulin resistance.Studies led byGerald I. Shulman, MD, PhD, George R. Cowgill Professor of Medicine (Endocrinology) and Cellular and Molecular Physiology, Investigator Emeritus of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and co-director of the Yale Diabetes Research Center, have demonstrated that exercise can reverse muscle insulin resistance.\\u201cInsulin resistance in skeletal muscle is a major factor in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease, heart disease, and obesity-associated cancers,\\u201d said Shulman, who recommends daily exercise to promote cardiometabolic health. \\u201cThere is also increasing evidence that insulin resistance may be a contributing factor in the progression of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease.\\u201d2. Exercise aids in recovery from infection.Exercise can reduce the risk of poor outcomes when infections occur, according toScott Roberts, MD, assistant professor of medicine (infectious diseases). \\u201cFor many infections, such as influenza, COVID-19, and RSV, comorbidities such as obesity, diabetes, and poor respiratory health are all major contributors to severe disease,\\u201d he said. \\u201cExercise can help mitigate these risks and boost the odds of a speedy recovery.\\u201d3. Exercise enhances immunity.There is evidence that light to moderate aerobic exercise, like walking or jogging, can help the immune system work better, saysElise Liu, MD, PhD, instructor of medicine (rheumatology, allergy and immunology). \\u201cPeople who regularly get this type of exercise get sick less frequently than people who are sedentary,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThis could be because several types of immune cells have been shown to work better shortly after exercise.\\u201d4. Exercise contributes to a healthy gut.Evidence suggests that exercise leads to a more diverse gut microbiome and an increase in butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid that may prevent disease, according toAvlin Imaeda, MD, PhD, associate professor of medicine (digestive diseases). \\u201cButyrate is one of the key fuels that the cells lining the colon need to grow, divide, and stay healthy, and higher levels of butyrate can reduce the severity of inflammatory bowel disease and the risk of colon cancer, as well as general inflammation,\\u201d she said.5. Exercise improves sleep.Exercising during the day can help you sleep at night, notesBrienne Miner, MD, MHS, assistant professor of medicine (geriatric medicine). \\u201cExercise is an external cue to your circadian clock, sending a physiologic message that lets your brain and body know when it is time to be awake versus when it is time to sleep,\\u201d she said. \\u201cA robust and regular circadian clock allows more regular and restorative sleep.\\u201dRegular physical activity also contributes to better physical and mental health, decreasing the risk of developing sleep problems and potentially improving existing sleep problems, Miner said.The Department of Internal Medicine at Yale School of Medicine is among the nation's premier departments, bringing together an elite cadre of clinicians, investigators, educators, and staff in one of the world's top medical schools.

Five medical students (Chinye Ijile, Amanda Lieberman, Kingson Lin, Victoria Marks, and Jamieson O\\u2019Marr) made thesis presentations, and over 75 students, from across Yale\\u2019s health profession schools, displayed scientific posters and engaged with attendees during the poster session.\\u201cToday we\\u2019re showcasing a diverse range of mentored research\\u2014spanning from fundamental basic science, to implementation science\\u2014performed by student investigators from across the health professions schools,\\u201d Associate Dean for Student Research Sarwat Chaudhry, MD, professor of medicine (general medicine), said in opening remarks. Associate Dean for Student Research Erica Herzog, MD, PhD, John Slade Ely Professor of Medicine (pulmonary) and professor of pathology, added, \\u201cWe take immense pride in Yale\\u2019s deep-rooted tradition of embedding research within medical education. For our students, experience in scientific investigation isn't merely a stepping stone towards a successful residency match or a career in academic research; it's foundational training for their lifelong commitment to medicine.\\u201dFarr LectureThe Lee E. Farr MD Endowed Lectureship and the presentation of the Dr. John N. Forrest, Jr., Mentorship Award, which bookended the student thesis presentations, honored YSM faculty for their outstanding mentorship. In introducing Peter Aronson, MD, C.N.H. Long Professor of Medicine (Nephrology) and professor of cellular and molecular physiology, as the Farr lecturer, Nancy J. Brown, MD, Jean and David W. Wallace Dean and C.N.H. Long Professor of Internal Medicine, explained that the lecture aims to stimulate thinking and to inspire students to strive to achieve more effective leadership and educational roles in society. Brown said that Aronson, who has been at YSM for 50 years since joining as a nephrology fellow in 1974, \\u201cepitomizes these qualities as a physician-scientist, educator, mentor, and colleague. As such, there is no one more fitting to speak at today\\u2019s event.\\u201dAs chief of the Section of Nephrology from 1987-2002, Brown said, Aronson nurtured the development of numerous physician-scientists, both as faculty and fellows, many of whom became recognized leaders\\u2014and many of whom remain at Yale and were present on SRD. \\u201cIt goes without saying\\u201d Brown concluded, \\u201cthat Dr. Aronson\\u2019s stewardship is one reason for the enduring strength of Yale\\u2019s 200-year tradition of medical student research,\\u201d noting he had been part of the tradition for one quarter of the 200 years. (In comments after Aronson spoke, Herzog noted several of his student evaluations simply said GOAT: \\u201cGreatest Of All Time.\\u201d)Using his own experiences as examples in his lecture titledFrom Sugar to Salt to Stones: Serendipitous Journey as Mentee and Mentor,Aronson noted the importance of chance events and serendipitous research findings in determining the course of his academic development and research career. (This article describes his remarks in detail.) In closing, Aronson honored the late John N. Forrest, Jr., professor emeritus of medicine and the founding director of YSM\\u2019s Office of Student Research (OSR). Forrest, he said, \\u201cexemplified extraordinary commitment to the process of education and mentorship,\\u201d adding \\u201cwe should all be inspired by his example of what is most gratifying in academic medicine.\\u201dDr. John N. Forrest, Jr., Mentorship AwardChaudhry similarly honored John N. Forrest, Jr. in introducing the mentorship award established to recognize his legacy. \\u201cAs many of you know, Dr. Forrest died earlier this year, and so this year\\u2019s Forrest Prize holds special meaning.\\u201d OSR \\u201cwas his pride and joy,\\u201d Chaudhry said, adding that since starting their roles as associate deans of student research in 2020, \\u201cDr. Herzog and I have continually been impressed by Dr. Forrest\\u2019s care and foresight in establishing the Office of Student Research. Dr. Forrest\\u2019s legacy lives on in the enduring strength of YSM\\u2019s medical student research program.\\u201dBefore Forrest\\u2019s son, John K.

Some of the most touching correspondence we received were from medical students, residents, and fellows whom he had mentored while at Yale. There is no greater evidence of the lasting impact that mentorship plays in the lives of young physicians that the words contained in those letters.\\u201dTurning to the awardee, Forrest said, \\u201cDr. Farhadian is an exemplary mentor,\\u201d and pointed to her role \\u201cin shaping the careers of her mentees, many of whom have garnered multiple awards and recognition, and published first author manuscripts under her tutelage.\\u201dHe then shared what a student wrote about Farhadian: \\u201cDr. Farhadian is such a fantastic mentor and person. As my mentor she encouraged me to apply for grants and submit to conferences and journals and has always made herself available to answer any questions that I have. She also facilitates an environment in which her mentees feel comfortable coming to her with questions and offers help in connecting me with doctors in my fields of interest. Beyond my research with Dr. Farhadian, she has also proved to be an invaluable resource in terms of developing as a student and a future doctor. She is an inspiring woman in medicine, and I hope to become as caring and capable as a doctor and mentor as she models.\\u201dUpon receiving the award, Farhadian said, \\u201cIt means a great deal for me to receive this award in Dr. Forrest\\u2019s name.

One of the major nutrients for tumors is glucose. Research has shown that insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas, is key to regulating glucose uptake into tumors. Insulin tells various cells in the body to take up glucose in response to a meal to use for energy.Individuals with obesity tend to be insulin resistant, meaning their cells don\\u2019t take up glucose in response to insulin. When that occurs, our bodies produce more insulin to allow us to overcome that insulin resistance. Insulin is both a growth factor and a metabolic factor in cells. Insulin tells tumor cells to take up glucose like it tells liver and muscle cells to take up glucose.The problem is tumor cells do not become insulin resistant, whereas other cells in the body do. In an individual with obesity and insulin resistance, tumor cells continue to take up more glucose in response to insulin, but the other cells in the body do not. When insulin levels are high, and other cells aren't responding, more glucose is funneled into tumor cells.Are there ways to reduce the risk of developing this type of cancer?Numerous studies have shown that low-carbohydrate diets and exercise can be beneficial.Have you found anything surprising in your research?We did a study in preclinical models in which we combined a drug called dichloroacetate, which can activate glucose oxidation, with immunotherapy. We thought that if you activate glucose metabolism, it could improve the response to immunotherapy. The drug didn't slow tumor growth, but it did reduce cancer-related fatigue.We weren\\u2019t expecting to go in the direction of cancer-related fatigue, but my philosophy in the lab is we follow the science. Ninety percent of patients with cancer report substantial fatigue that impairs their quality of life and reduces the probability that they will complete cancer treatment. Currently, there are no effective medications for this debilitating condition. We hope that this drug can potentially help these patients.What is the future of treatment for metabolism-related cancers?There are 13 tumor types that the CDC has associated with obesity. But there are also people with a BMI under 30 who have metabolic dysfunction, and there are people with a BMI over 30 who do not have metabolic dysfunction. One key thing that we need to do is nuance our understanding of what obesity means and link tumor factors to metabolic dysfunction rather than BMI.We are working to learn more about how systemic metabolism affects the immune response to cancer and the tumor's metabolic response to cancer. We hope to repurpose metabolic drugs used for diabetes or obesity to potentially improve cancer treatment.We showed in a paper published a couple of years ago that in various breast cancer preclinical models, depending on the tumor genetics, different models respond better to insulin-lowering therapies. That research opens the possibility of developing precision medicine-type approaches to use metabolic therapy for cancer. That\\u2019s our goal moving on.Yale School of Medicine\\u2019sSection of Endocrinology and Metabolism works to improve the health of individuals with endocrine and metabolic diseases by advancing scientific knowledge, applying new information to patient care, and training the next generation of physicians and scientists to become leaders in the field.

Leckman and Kyle D. Pruett, first met renowned Italian artist-songwriterGiovanni Caccamo, who together with his colleagues from the Andrea Bocelli Foundation, had just presented to member states at the United Nations Secretariat on the success of their global programs to benefit children in need and to empower youth through words and music. Dr. Pruett, tenor soloist and former YaleWhiffenpoof,shared that he and the All-City Children\\u2019s Choir of New Haven, under the direction of the Yale School of Music\\u2019sMusic in Schools Initiative(MISI), had recently performed\\u201cSeeds of Peace\\u201d,song of hope and anthem of theEarly Childhood Peace Consortium(ECPC), a global network, co-founded by Drs. Leckman, Pruett, and others  on how investment in Early Childhood Development (ECD) can lead to more peaceful societies. But, it was Caccamo\\u2019s story about his life long passion for music and his youth advocacy projectManifesto for Change \\u2013 Youth and Futurethat sparked the professors' interest and desire to learn more.It all began in 2021 ...... when Caccamo released his concept album \\u201cParola\\u201d, a musical response to a call by notable Italian writer Andrea Camilleri, whose growing concern for the future compelled him to call upon youth to elicit a new humanism through the value of words. Each track in the album is an interpretation in music and word of a well-known poem or text from literature, featuring collaborations with globally renowned artists Patti Smith, Willem Dafoe, Jesse Paris Smith, and others.Yet, Caccamo felt the need to take Camilleri's call beyond the stage. In collaboration with the Vatican Museums and MAXXI - National Museum of XXI Century Arts, he launched the advocacy projectVoices to the Youngin 2022. He called for ideas from a diverse group of young people in Italy to compose and submit essays in response to two roll calls, \\u201cWhat do you want to change in the society in which you live and how? What is your word for change?\\u201dOf the thousands of submissions received, Caccamo selected 60 of the most inspirational essays that were published in the volume \\\"Manifesto del cambiamento\\\" in 2023, which includes works by masters in visual art, along with a preface by Pope Francis, \\u201cLetter to Young People\\u201d. Fifteen top essay winners joined him in an artistic performance inside Raffaello\\u2019s Stanza della Segnatura in the Vatican Museums, to discuss change and the future, juxtaposed against the famous School of Athens fresco, a gathering of ancient philosophers, mathematicians, and scientists. (See \\\"Summary: Manifesto for Change).But Caccamo felt compelled to take Camilleri's call further still, to the world stage. On April 5, 2024, he launched a global version of the book project at theChange the World Model UN NYCthat called together 5,000 youth advocates from around the world. In his speech, he issued a global call for ideas to young people from all religions, cultures, gender identities, and social backgrounds to build the \\\"Manifesto for Change\\\", a global book that will collect the stories, the longings, and the outlooks of the new generations.It was then that Professors Leckman and Pruett invited Caccamo to visit with them at Yale, to meet with ECPCs new Youth Group Chair/Yale student Kyle King, and to lead aManifesto for Change - Youth and Futureworkshop to which the youth community at Yale could participate.In conversation with Yale student Kyle King and Giovanni Caccamo on \\u201cYouth and Future -  Manifesto for Change\\u201dI'd like to think that the younger generations are going to be                                           tomorrow's leaders, and that they definitely need a chance                                                          to have a say in what tomorrow looks like.Kyle KingFilmed on April 17 in theHarvey Cushing Historical Libraryof rare books in the Yale School of Medicine, Yale student Kyle King, and guest Giovanni Caccamo, engaged in a captivating and inspiring conversation on the capacity of youth to elicit a new humanism to drive positive change.King\\u2019s inquisitiveness prompted Caccamo to share the story of his passion for music and the arts that stem from personal experiences, including the loss of his father at a young age. After much introspection and soul-searching during adolescence, his grief became gratitude and the appreciation for the preciousness of his life, a daily practice. Caccamo encourages young people to reflect on the positive aspects of their lives. He emphasizes the power of collaboration and the need for intergenerational dialogue in shaping a brighter future.The conversation ends on a high note with Caccamo\\u2019s a cappella performance of \\\"Change\\\", the English version of\\u201cIl Cambiamento\\u201d, theManifesto for Changesignature song of youth empowerment, and message of hope for global transformation.[Also available onApple Podcast - ECPCs Pathways to Peace: \\\"ECPCs Kyle King interviews Giovanni Caccamo\\u2014Youth & Future: Manifesto for Change\\\"]Workshop on the \\u201cManifesto for Change: Youth and Future\\u201dI'm asking all Yale students and youth, all special souls to reflect on some aspects in your society that you want to change, or something that you want to paint in a new way.

I was walking with my friend\\u2019s 4-year-old daughter Anna, through the suburbs of Tehran, Iran, when we got to a hill whitened with dandelions. \\u201cWhat is this?\\u201d she asked in awe. \\u201cThe land of dreams!\\u201d I replied on top of my mind. \\u201cWhat does it mean?\\u201d she asked. \\u201cYou can make wishes and blow them into the wind as much as you want.\\u201d I said. \\u201cLike, till forever?\\u201d she asked. \\u201cTill forever!\\u201d I affirmed, although the words weighed heavy on my tongue as I said it. How long had it been since the last time I had wished, just for the sake of wishing, without calculating the obstacles, the costs, or the time?But Anna started giggling as she ran among the dandelions. \\u201cCome join me!\\u201d, she laughed. I lost my thread of thoughts while following her, trusting that she had life much better figured out that me, in all the past four years we had together. Anna was not aware of any limitations owing to her. Neither was I, but then for only a few minutes.And there it was, in those moments, the gift of childhood, its essence at its purest, something so easy to forget, yet so hard to remember. And yes, dandelions can grow almost anywhere, on any green piece of God\\u2019s land, through stones, on mountains, and in cracks in the streets and walls. So can wishes, most especially, hopes for change. But even dandelions cannot survive when the ground beneath them is shaking endlessly ... and so, cannot wishes, many of them.And so, my word for change is:Stability.Laya Jalilian-Khave, M.D.AboutKyle Kingis a Yale University student who serves as Chair of the Youth Initiative at the Early Childhood Peace Consortium (ECPC).

Fuctito is associate professor of psychiatry at Yale School of Medicine.Benjamin Toll, PhD, director of the Tobacco Treatment Program at MUSC Health, adjunct professor of psychiatry at Yale School of Medicine, and senior author on the study, said the researchers designed the trial to mimic real-world conditions as much as possible \\u2013 from the people who enrolled in the trial to the type of support they would likely receive from primary care providers.The publication of their results closely follows publication of a trial of cytisinicline for e-cigarette cessation. The two drugs work similarly. However, varenicline is already on the market in the U.S. in generic versions while cytisinicline has not yet received FDA approval and is not currently available for use by patients.Varenicline, perhaps better known by the brand name Chantix, is FDA-approved to help adults to stop smoking traditional cigarettes. But, despite the growing numbers of people who use e-cigarettes, there are no approved medication options to help them to stop using e-cigarettes.\\u201cPeople can get to very high levels of nicotine exposure with these e-cigarette products, and they can use them near constantly throughout the day. So, the question we all have is, \\u2018Can any pharmacotherapy stand up to this challenge?\\u2019\\u201d Fucito said.It\\u2019s a question of logistics. People who smoke cigarettes have to get a cigarette from the pack and light it. It\\u2019s easy to track use. There are also natural stopping points \\u2013 when the cigarette is finished, it must be snuffed out, and when the pack is used up, it must be thrown away and a new one purchased and opened before the person can smoke again.E-cigarettes, however, can last for 5,000 or more puffs, making them harder to track in terms of intake but easier to use. Toll said he has patients who describe keeping their e-cigarettes under their pillows so they can vape right before going to sleep and then again immediately upon waking in the morning.Previous studies have shown that a majority of people using e-cigarettes want to quit. But it\\u2019s been unclear whether products used to stop smoking traditional combustible cigarettes would also work for e-cigarettes.\\u201cWe need more pharmacotherapy treatments to help address the really strong physical dependence that can develop from e-cigarette use,\\\" Fucito said. \\\"People undergo significant withdrawal when they try to stop, and that withdrawal is so unpleasant and hard to manage with just behavioral support alone.\\\"A recent Italian study married pharmacotherapy with intense weekly behavioral counseling sessions, and the trial of cytisinicline also included weekly 10-minute sessions with trained counselors.In this study, however, the researchers wanted to see how well the pharmacotherapy could work given typical health care conditions \\u2013 meaning, the patient would likely get a brief discussion with a primary care provider along with a prescription and information about resources for quitting but no follow-up counseling sessions.To recreate this, they developed a self-guided cessation booklet for patients, with practical tools and tips for quitting. A licensed health care provider also met with each patient to inform them of how to use the medication, offer brief advice and instruct them to set a quit date for one to two weeks after starting the medication.\\u201cWe took a much lighter touch to reflect the behavioral support that you\\u2019d likely experience if you went to your doctor and asked for help with quitting e-cigarettes,\\u201d Fucito said.The study also included some patients with histories of depression. This was significant because Chantix, at one point, had a \\u201cblack box warning\\u201d after reports linking the drug to psychiatric side effects. That warning was dropped in 2016 after a very large study showed the drug to be safe, but Toll and Fucito said the stigma of the warning remains in the minds of both health care providers and the general public.\\u201cThere\\u2019s still some hesitancy to prescribe this very safe \\u2013 now generic \\u2013 drug, and it really shouldn't be that way,\\u201d Toll said.None of the participants in this study experienced serious side effects, although a larger study would be needed to verify this finding. Most of the side effects were along the lines of nausea, insomnia or vivid dreams.Another piece of good news \\u2013 those who stopped vaping didn\\u2019t boomerang back to cigarettes.\\u201cIf you have a former smoking history, one of the worries in the field is that you\\u2019re going to go back to smoking when you quit vaping,\\u201d Toll said. \\u201cAnd we did not find that.\\u201dOn the other hand, one potential challenge that the researchers uncovered in the results indicated that people without a cigarette smoking history \\u2013 in other words, those who have only ever used e-cigarettes \\u2013 might have a harder time quitting. That could be because that group is more likely to use e-cigarettes continuously throughout the day, therefore getting more nicotine into their systems.Larger trials are needed to delve into these questions. But this trial, at least, should give health care providers some confidence in prescribing varenicline for patients trying to stop using e-cigarettes.\\u201cWe want people to come back to this medication,\\u201d Fucito said. \\u201cThere are people who need help now and are likely to struggle to quit e-cigarettes on their own because the technology facilitates nicotine use on a level that we\\u2019ve never seen before.\\u201d\"], [\"Search for Affordable Treatment Option for Liver Disease\", \"Metabolic-associated steatolic liver disease (MASLD \\u2014 previously called non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) affects nearly one in three adults in the United States and worldwide. It is the fastest rising cause of liver transplantation and one of the most common causes of chronic liver disease worldwide. A subgroup of those patients has the more severe form of the disease, called metabolic steatohepatitis (MASH \\u2013 previously non-alcoholic steatohepatitis), where the disease progresses faster towards end-stage liver disease including cirrhosis and liver cancer.Until very recently, no treatment options were available forMASLD. \\u201cThe cornerstone of management for MASLD had been weight loss, which is typically associated with a decrease in the level of fat deposits in the liver,\\u201d saidBubu Banini, MD, PhD, assistant professor of medicine (digestive diseases) and translational research director of theMetabolic Health and Weight Loss Program. \\u201cHowever, weight loss is not easy or sustainable for many patients, and they were left without any other treatment options.\\u201dIn March 2024, theFood and Drug Administration (FDA) approved resmetirom, sold under the brand name Rezdiffra\\u2122, the first therapy for MASH. The drug was approved through FDA\\u2019s accelerated approval pathway, and is intended to be used as an adjunct to diet and exercise.\\u201cWhile the new proprietary drug has the potential to help many patients, there remains a need for a generic, affordable treatment option for patients with MASH,\\u201d said Banini. \\u201cThe drug development process is long and expensive, involving preclinical studies and several phases of clinical study. It can take several decades and cost billions of dollars \\u2013 which ultimately adds to the final price of the drug. So, even though a drug has been approved, there will be major issues of financial viability for a large percentage of the population.\\u201dBanini was recently awarded a $3.05 million R01 grant by theNational Institutes of Health (NIH)for a five-year research project to investigate the feasibility of oral digoxin as a treatment for MASH. Digoxin is a relatively inexpensive and widely available drug that is frequently used to treat patients with certain heart conditions. Banini identified digoxin as a potential therapy option after reviewing extensive preclinical work, including research byXinshou Ouyang, PhD, assistant professor (digestive diseases) andWajahat Mehal, MD, PhD, professor (digestive disease), that showed digoxin has the potential to decrease inflammation and fibrosis in the liver caused by both MASH and alcohol-associated liver disease.\\u201cDigoxin has been used in a medicinal capacity for more than a century, which means we have a lot of data on its safety profile when used in the clinical arena. All of this gives us a step ahead. We don\\u2019t need to spend years and resources developing a novel agent or learning if the treatment is safe in humans,\\u201d said Banini. \\u201cThis kind of research is not very attractive to industry but has the potential to make a major public health impact in the U.S. and internationally.\\u201dBanini is developing a single-site clinical trial to determine if digoxin reduces steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis in patients with MASH. Patients will be randomized to one of three arms: one arm will receive a dose slightly lower than the standard dose of digoxin currently used with many cardiovascular patients; a second arm will receive a substantially lower dose of digoxin; and the third arm will receive a placebo. At the end of the 24-week treatment period, patients will have a liver biopsy to assess the effect on inflammation and fibrosis. Banini also aims to conduct translational research examining patient samples to better understand how the treatment works at a molecular level.Banini credits Yale\\u2019s academic environment and commitment to research as key to her pursuit of this field of study.\\u201cThere aren\\u2019t many places where you can get so much support, mentorship, and resources for research,\\u201d said Banini. \\u201cHaving access to robust research infrastructure helps make it possible to do this kind of work.\\u201dSince forming one of the nation\\u2019s first sections of hepatology more than 75 years ago and then gastroenterology nearly 70 years ago, Yale School of Medicine\\u2019s Section of Digestive Diseases has had an enduring impact on research and clinical care in gastrointestinal and liver disorders.

Finding the right specialist can help patients address respiratory conditions that impact day-to-day living.A pulmonologist is a physician who specializes in lung-related issues. Pulmonologists diagnose and treat various conditions, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchiectasis, pulmonary fibrosis, sarcoidosis, lung cancer, cystic fibrosis, pulmonary vascular disease, and obstructive sleep apnea. They evaluate and identify the causes of shortness of breath and persistent cough.TheSection of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicinein the Yale School of Medicine Department of Internal Medicine has world-renowned experts in every subspecialty of respiratory medicine who use the latest guidelines and research to help patients manage a broad range of lung conditions.Following are five examples of when health care professionals may consider referring a patient to a pulmonologist:1. If a patient has ongoing shortness of breath.Geoffrey Chupp, MD, professor of medicine and director of theYale Center for Asthma and Airways Disease, emphasizes the importance of properly determining the cause of breathing difficulties. \\u201cShortness of breath has many causes and often hinders a person\\u2019s ability to live a normal life and exercise,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThe condition can be a sign of asthma, COPD, long COVID, or pulmonary hypertension, and is also a common symptom associated with cardiac issues, blood clots in the lung, anemia, and deconditioning.\\u201d A thorough evaluation that includes a physical exam, lung function testing, blood work, and imaging is often required to identify the cause, he added.2. If a patient has recurrent chest infections or a persistent cough.\\u201cPatients experiencing recurrent chest infections or chronic cough may have underlying lung tissue abnormalities that predispose them to these symptoms,\\u201d saidAshley Losier, MD, assistant professor of medicine and director of theYale Bronchiectasis and NTM Infections Program. \\u201cA pulmonary expert can provide evaluation and management.\\u201d Losier and her colleagues counsel patients regarding strategies to treat chronic respiratory tract infections, including one caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria.3. If an imaging test, such as a chest X-ray or CT scan, detects abnormalities in the lungs.Sometimes, imaging tests find spots on the lungs called lung nodules. These nodules are often benign scars, but sometimes they indicate the development of a lung disease, a chronic infection, or cancer. Evaluation by a pulmonologist can help determine the cause.Patients diagnosed with lung cancer benefit from significant advancements that have been made over the past two decades. \\u201cLung cancer screening is now recommended for many individuals with a history of smoking,\\u201d saidLynn Tanoue, MD, MBA, professor of medicine and director of theLung Cancer Screening Programat Yale. \\u201cBy detecting lung cancer early, we can save many lives.\\u201d4. If a patient has excessive sleepiness during the day or loud snoring at night, possible indications of a sleep disorder.Sleep-disordered breathing, such as obstructive sleep apnea, can negatively impact cardiovascular and metabolic health, according toKlar Yaggi, MD, MPH, professor of medicine, who leads theYale Sleep Medicine Program. Pulmonologists can diagnose, evaluate, and treat sleep problems, helping to improve a patient\\u2019s health, well-being, and quality of life.5. Patients with occluded or blocked blood vessels in the lung may need to see a pulmonologist for specialized care.Pulmonologists can evaluate short- and long-term conditions caused by pulmonary embolism, saysAkhil Khosla, MD, assistant professor of medicine and director of Yale New Haven Health\\u2019s Pulmonary Embolism Response Team. \\u201cPulmonologists play a key role in assessing, treating, and managing the care of patients with post-pulmonary embolism impairment,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThis condition can be debilitating and progressive, leading to higher rates of illness and death.\\u201dPatients with pulmonary symptoms who are referred to Yale\\u2019s nationally ranked multidisciplinary pulmonary center receive important care, including diagnostic tests, procedures, and treatments informed by the latest cutting-edge research, according toNaftali Kaminski, MD, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Professor of Medicine and chief of Yale-PCCSM. \\u201cMore importantly, our experts establish a caring relationship with each patient and communicate promptly with referring physicians to ensure the best possible outcomes,\\u201d he said.Other Yale-PCCSM programs include theAdult Cystic Fibrosis Program,Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Program, Chronic Pulmonary Infection Research and Treatment Program, Comprehensive Pulmonary Medicine Program,Pulmonary Vascular Diseases Program,Tuberculosis Program, andYale Interstitial Lung Disease Center of Excellence, housed at theWinchester Center for Lung Disease, in North Haven.The Section of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine is one of the eleven sections within Yale School of Medicine\\u2019s Department of Internal Medicine.

As Yale School of Medicine (YSM) MD student Bassel Shanab explains, students were graduating \\u201cfeeling uncomfortable in their ability to provide care to transgender and nonbinary patients.\\u201d Although, he says, there were pre-clinical lectures on the physiology of hormones in hormone replacement therapy, the negative and damaging effects of gender dysphoria, and societal discrimination, \\u201cwe lacked the in-person clinical instruction that would ensure students can confidently serve such a marginalized group of patients.\\\"MD student Ryan Bahar, who was involved with the initiative, adds, \\u201cTransgender and gender diverse (TGD) individuals experience alarming health disparities compared to their cisgender counterparts. While there are many reasons for this unacceptable status quo, from lack of insurance to outright discrimination, one is particularly important to grapple with in medical education: students are not sufficiently trained to provide adequate health care to TGD individuals.\\u201dA group of students at YSM\\u2014led by MD-PhD student Kyle Gavulic\\u2014made developing curriculum to fill this gap a priority in the wake of various state-mandated restrictions on gender-affirming care. The students connected with Assistant Professor of Pediatrics Meredithe McNamara, MD, MS, and MD student Christine Lepore, who were working onevidence-based medico-legal responsesto some of these bans. This led to brainstorming about enhancing YSM\\u2019s curriculum.Creating curricular contentThe group brought in John Encandela, PhD, executive director of evaluation & assessment, Center for Medical Education; Jaideep Talwalkar, MD, assistant dean for education and director of clinical skills; Beverley Sheares, MD, MS, Health Equity Thread (HET) leader; and Douglas Shenson, MD, MPH, MA, MS, HET deputy leader. The students completed a literature review of existing medical education curricula on gender-affirming care across the country, as well as a needs assessment of the YSM curricula, and developed a proposal for a \\\"meta\\\" curriculum, unique to YSM\\u2019s teaching model but derived from two validated curricula, on clinical skills in caring for transgender and gender diverse patients.The group piloted the curriculum in January 2023, in partnership with HAVEN Free Clinic, training 13 medical, nursing, and PA student volunteers. The pilot demonstrated the curriculum was effective. (The project team presented their findingson a posterat YSM\\u2019s Medical Education Day in 2023.)The conversation then shifted to where this training would fit best in the curriculum and which students would receive it. It was decided that all MD and MD-PhD clerkship students would participate during a precede, which is the orientation before each clerkship rotation. The first 40 MD students participated in the training in March 2024, and it received excellent reviews. The remaining students will participate later this year. Assuming the feedback remains positive, the training will become a permanent part of the precede curriculum.Recruiting simulated participantsSimulated participants (SPs) are an important component of the training. Gavulic explains, \\u201cOur goal was to recruit from the local transgender and gender diverse community so that our actors possessed the lived experiences of the patient population we were aiming to empower health professional students to better care for.\\u201d Jillian Celentano, LMSW, an SP and a mentor and advocate for the trans community, \\u201chas been a very close and absolutely critical partner in this work,\\u201d Gavulic adds. \\u201cWe really couldn't have pulled this off without her.\\u201d Celentano recruited all the volunteers for the pilot and was a key player in the recruitment effort to hire enough SPs to train all medical students, which was led by Barbara Hildebrand, BFA, assistant director of the Simulated Participant Program, which is part of theYale Center for Healthcare Simulation.Hildebrand explains they were seeking individuals \\u201cto embody fictional patients with specific gender journeys authentically. This requires staying in character, adhering to case details, providing feedback, and repeating the portrayal multiple times within a two-hour workshop.\\u201dLeveraging YSM\\u2019s existing SP community, which included eight people who identified as transgender or gender diverse, Hildebrand embarked on an innovative recruitment strategy, which resulted in six new SPs. Partnering with Program Coordinator A Gould, they created trans-friendly recruiting posters, and Hildebrand forged partnerships with local colleges and universities through their DEI offices. Hildebrand calls Gavulic and Celentano \\u201cinvaluable\\u201d partners, who were \\u201creferring applicants and connecting me with gender affirming health care practices in CT to share the job posting.\\u201dCelentano expects most new recruits will continue as SPs \\u201cbecause they realize the impact they are having,\\u201d and explains, \\u201cWe are petrified to go to a new medical provider. We know there is a big gap with providers who are trained to engage with gender diverse patients.\\u201d\\\"It is immensely gratifying for our SP Program to play a pivotal role in delivering cutting-edge curriculum to our medical students,\\u201d says Hildebrand. She adds that the SPs\\u2019 \\u201cwillingness to be vulnerable creates a safe environment for students to learn and practice essential skills, ultimately shaping them into compassionate health care providers for transgender and gender diverse patients. I am incredibly proud of the SPs\\u2019 courage and the profound impact they have on our educational mission.\\\"ImpactEncandela says he is \\u201ccertain that this workshop would not exist without the steady and patient efforts of a small group of students dedicated to making this happen. They saw the gap in the curriculum; did the necessary groundwork to identify necessary resources; conducted a proof-of-concept pilot; and worked with faculty and administrative leaders in getting the workshop into the regular clerkship curriculum.\\u201d He credits Gavulic for \\u201cspearheading the effort and remaining steadfast through the process of development to implementation.\\u201dReflecting on the initiative, Gavulic says, it \\u201cnot only tremendously advanced YSM's undergraduate medical education on trans health care, but also promises to nourish generations of graduating YSM students in feeling competent enough to provide the same quality of care to the trans and gender diverse community and to counter the spread of disinformation. This dual-pronged aim is truly what this is all about so that trans and gender diverse patients can feel safe and affirmed while seeking health care.\\u201dEchoing these points, McNamara notes, \\u201cTrans and gender-expansive people are more visible than ever and the evidence regarding the benefits of gender-affirming care has never been stronger.\\u201d Therefore, she continues, \\u201cthis is a natural time to make sure that emerging physicians are fully equipped with clinical skills to provide welcoming, evidence-based and comprehensive care to gender diverse people.\\u201d Additionally, McNamara is concerned that \\u201cthe misinformation climate regarding gender-affirming care is quite virulent now,\\u201d leading to policies that restrict access to care for trans and gender-expansive people. The medical community, she says, \\u201cincluding emerging physicians, are powerful and credible messengers who can dispel myths and protect marginalized people.\\u201dIn addition to those mentioned in the article, the project team would like to acknowledge MD student Shamik Bhat and MPH student Sujana Nelakanti for their invaluable contributions in developing and implementing the curriculum; Manager of Clinical Medical Education Programs Gina Franco and Clerkship Director Shefali Pathy, MD, MPH, for their unwavering support in implementing this into the Clerkship curriculum; and all the faculty champions for their expertise and generosity of their time to make this a success, including Anika Anam, MD, Iman Berrahou, MD, Susan Boulware, MD, Diane Bruessow, MPAS, PA-C, Joseph Canarie, MD, Mukta Dhond, MD, Barbara Gulanski, MD, MPH, Allister Hirschmann, PA-C, Nathan Levitt, FNP-BC, MSN, RN, MA, Nicolas Meade, PsyD, Christy Olezeski, PhD, Allura Ralston, PhD, Jenn Suski, APRN, and Tristan Marvin Uy, MD, MPH.\"], [\"Celebrating Health Profession Students' Poetry, Prose, and Visual Arts \", \"Care TakerThese Small ThingsHungerBlack Motherhood in MedicineThese are the titles of the poetry, prose, and visual artworks that received first-place in the annual Yale School of Medicine (YSM) Program for Humanities in Medicine (PHM) Health Professions Students' Creative Writing & Art Contest. On May 2, the student winners were celebrated at a gathering where they shared and often provided context for their creations. A supportive and appreciative audience applauded enthusiastically after each presentation.Professor and PHM Director Anna Reisman, MD, welcomed everyone to the celebration, sharing that the contest began more than two decades ago. It originally was a poetry and prose contest just for medical students; the family of Marguerite Rush Lerner, MD, established and endowed the contest to honor her. Lerner was a dermatologist at YSM, as well as a children\\u2019s book author. (Lerner\\u2019s husband, Aaron Lerner, MD, PhD, was the first chair of Yale\\u2019s Department of Dermatology, and two of their four sons, Ethan Lerner, MD, PhD \\u201882 and Michael Lerner, MD \\u201981, attended YSM.) Reisman explained that several years ago the contest expanded to include visual arts, and also students from across the health profession schools and programs\\u2014MD, MD-PhD, Physician Associate, Physician Assistant Online, Nursing, and Public Health.This year, almost 100 students participated in the contest.

Now, as a second-year student, I created a piece that captures something I have thought much about these past two years.\\u201dHuggins grew up in a Caribbean household close to art and culture from all over the world. \\u201cI\\u2019ve always been surrounded by music, dance, storytelling, and visual art, and my family hosted international students throughout my childhood. I started playing the piano at age three, and have been singing, dancing, and doodling for as long as I can remember.\\u201d However, it was not until she was an undergraduate at Duke University and participated in community service that she \\u201cbegan to understand the therapeutic value of art.\\u201dThrough her involvement in different programs at that time, including Families Moving Forward, a shelter for families without homes, and Reflections, a weekly art program for adults with dementia at Duke Nasher Museum, Huggins says, \\u201cI saw how encouraging self-expression could bring peace during uncertain times, reduce stress, and empower communities. When I went through a rough time in my sophomore year, I found myself using painting for a lot of healing.\\u201dHuggins continues, \\u201cI will continue practicing art. It\\u2019s a self-care practice that helps me combat burnout and show up better for patients who need me.\\u201dSubmergedClass of 2025 MD student Hang Nguyen started painting at age 11, when her family immigrated to America from Vietnam. She explains, \\u201cI did not speak English at the time, so art was a vessel through which I could communicate my tumultuous adolescent mind.\\u201dCurrently, she paints often and says her favorite subject is \\u201csurreal, tranquil, and, occasionally, liminal landscapes, such as a classroom at midnight, an overgrown, abandoned church, and a long corridor that leads nowhere. For me, these landscapes represent a longing for a space that exists tranquilly, where one can be one's true self.\\u201dNguyen paintedSubmergedspecifically for this contest; \\u201cIn other words, this contest inspired me to look inward and reflect on \\u2014 instead of simply overcome and move forward from \\u2014 the challenges that I have encountered in medical school.\\u201d Through the work she wanted \\u201cto convey the various feelings that I experienced while studying for board exams using motifs that are near and dear to me like water and fish in a surreal, tranquil, and liminal ambience.\\u201d She painted it during time dedicated to Step 1, over the course of a week, working on it for an hour to two at night.Hunger,On Chinese Medicine, andOn the First Day of Anatomy LabFirst-year Physician Associate (PA) student Kelly Dunn was honored with three prizes: A tie for first place in prose forHunger, a tie for second place in poetry forOn Chinese Medicine, and honorable mention in prose forOn the First Day of Anatomy Lab, each of which she shared with the audience. While Dunn, who \\u201calways considered the humanities to be a part of my life,\\u201d has been an avid reader and artist for as long as she can remember, she did not start writing until the COVID-19 pandemic.

One of the major nutrients for tumors is glucose. Research has shown that insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas, is key to regulating glucose uptake into tumors. Insulin tells various cells in the body to take up glucose in response to a meal to use for energy.Individuals with obesity tend to be insulin resistant, meaning their cells don\\u2019t take up glucose in response to insulin. When that occurs, our bodies produce more insulin to allow us to overcome that insulin resistance. Insulin is both a growth factor and a metabolic factor in cells. Insulin tells tumor cells to take up glucose like it tells liver and muscle cells to take up glucose.The problem is tumor cells do not become insulin resistant, whereas other cells in the body do. In an individual with obesity and insulin resistance, tumor cells continue to take up more glucose in response to insulin, but the other cells in the body do not. When insulin levels are high, and other cells aren't responding, more glucose is funneled into tumor cells.Are there ways to reduce the risk of developing this type of cancer?Numerous studies have shown that low-carbohydrate diets and exercise can be beneficial.Have you found anything surprising in your research?We did a study in preclinical models in which we combined a drug called dichloroacetate, which can activate glucose oxidation, with immunotherapy. We thought that if you activate glucose metabolism, it could improve the response to immunotherapy. The drug didn't slow tumor growth, but it did reduce cancer-related fatigue.We weren\\u2019t expecting to go in the direction of cancer-related fatigue, but my philosophy in the lab is we follow the science. Ninety percent of patients with cancer report substantial fatigue that impairs their quality of life and reduces the probability that they will complete cancer treatment. Currently, there are no effective medications for this debilitating condition. We hope that this drug can potentially help these patients.What is the future of treatment for metabolism-related cancers?There are 13 tumor types that the CDC has associated with obesity. But there are also people with a BMI under 30 who have metabolic dysfunction, and there are people with a BMI over 30 who do not have metabolic dysfunction. One key thing that we need to do is nuance our understanding of what obesity means and link tumor factors to metabolic dysfunction rather than BMI.We are working to learn more about how systemic metabolism affects the immune response to cancer and the tumor's metabolic response to cancer. We hope to repurpose metabolic drugs used for diabetes or obesity to potentially improve cancer treatment.We showed in a paper published a couple of years ago that in various breast cancer preclinical models, depending on the tumor genetics, different models respond better to insulin-lowering therapies. That research opens the possibility of developing precision medicine-type approaches to use metabolic therapy for cancer. That\\u2019s our goal moving on.Yale School of Medicine\\u2019sSection of Endocrinology and Metabolism works to improve the health of individuals with endocrine and metabolic diseases by advancing scientific knowledge, applying new information to patient care, and training the next generation of physicians and scientists to become leaders in the field.

And among critically ill patients, why do some eventually recover while others do not?A new study has unveiled clues for helping scientists predict who is most at risk for severe COVID-19, and among those who experience severe disease, who is most likely to survive. The study drew on data from the Immunophenotyping Assessment in a COVID-19 Cohort (IMPACC) study, a partnership between the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and 15 research institutions across the country, including Yale School of Medicine (YSM).This could be the largest-scale COVID-19 study by far that has looked at so many different \\u2018omics\\u2019 simultaneously and over time.Leying Guan, PhDCollaborators conducted extensive analyses across many different aspects of the immune responses of over 1,000 patients across the country. They assessed samples during hospitalization and for up to a year post-hospitalization to better understand the disease\\u2019s heterogeneity.  The IMPACC multiomics approach, which combines multiple \\u201comics\\u201d such as genomics, proteomics, and transcriptomics, is one of the largest and most comprehensive analyses to date.The researchers published their findingsin theJournal of Clinical Investigationon May 1.COVID-19 has a vast array of manifestations in patients. To identify distinguishing features leading to different patient responses, IMPACC is using a systems immunology approach pioneered by the NIAID's Human Immunology Project Consortium (HIPC). The HIPC is directed at Yale by IMPACC membersRuth R. Montgomery, PhD, professor of medicine and of epidemiology (microbial diseases) and associate dean for scientific affairs at YSM, andDavid A. Hafler, MD, chair and William S. and Lois Stiles Edgerly Professor of Neurology.Steven Kleinstein, PhD, Anthony N. Brady Professor of Pathology at YSM, also a HIPC investigator, led the multi-site IMPACC data analysis working group to process the individual data types for integrated analysis by the consortium informatics experts.\\u201cMy group was tasked with taking the millions of datapoints from these 1,000-plus individuals and  using modeling to elucidate reasons why different people respond to COVID-19 differently and the molecular mechanisms behind it,\\u201d saysJeremy Gygi, a PhD candidate in Yale\\u2019s computational biology and bioinformatics program and first author of the study.New models look for patterns linked to COVID-19 outcomesIn their latest study, Gygi and the team wanted to identify signatures associated with severe COVID-19 infection and mortality. Furthermore, they examined interactions of these hallmarks to better understand the underlying immune cascade that occurs in critical cases. \\u201cWe didn\\u2019t just look at someone\\u2019s genes, proteins, and metabolites separately,\\u201d says Gygi. \\u201cInstead, we examined how transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic profiles for an individual work together in order to explain an outcome.\\u201d\\u201cThis could be the largest-scale COVID-19 study by far that has looked at so many different \\u2018omics\\u2019 simultaneously and over time,\\u201d addsLeying Guan, PhD, assistant professor of biostatistics at the Yale School of Public Health and the study\\u2019s senior author. \\u201cThese are unique aspects of our study and have enabled us to do more than what\\u2019s been done in the previous literature on COVID-19 biomarkers.\\u201dTo achieve this, the team leveraged the IMPACC dataset and a computational method known as latent factor modeling. These models helped the researchers identify coordinated patterns among the multitude of assays they studied. Their models had two main tasks. First, they wanted to identify drivers of severe disease. They looked for predictors that associated with the cohort\\u2019s five clinical trajectory groups, with five being the most severe, and with the distinct trajectories of disease. Second, among the most severe groups, the researchers also looked for signatures predictive of mortality. \\u201cWe were trying to separate those who needed hospitalization and ventilation and survived, and those who did not,\\u201d says Gygi.Study identifies signifiers of severe COVID-19 disease and deathThe severity model identified multiple factors significantly associated with COVID-19 disease trajectory, including inflammation,T cell lymphopenia, andcatabolism of the amino acid tryptophan. While many of these signatures had been identified in the COVID-19 literature, the new models added a temporal element to reveal how these hallmarks evolved over time and interacted with one another.Among the two most severe groups, an elevated discoordination of interferon signaling, which plays a vital role in immune response, significantly predicted mortality.\\u201cFor the severity cohort, although the hallmarks we found were already well-known, we identified an additional layer of interaction,\\u201d says Guan. \\u201cAmong the mortality cohort, we found an important type of dysregulation [of interferon signaling] that may characterize the fate of hospitalized patients.\\u201dThis study is a significant achievement and an exciting starting point, the researchers say, and they have plans to build on this work to better understand more aspects of COVID-19. For example, they hope to use similar modeling techniques to gain a better understanding of Long COVID and how it develops after an acute infection. By learning more about the intricacies of COVID-19\\u2019s underlying mechanisms, they hope to pave the way for new insights into more effective treatments for both acute and lingering disease.\"], [\"In the Early Steps of Cancer Formation, Timing Matters\", \"By the time cancer is diagnosed, a lot has already happened behind the scenes. Although cancers are classed into early and late stages for clinical purposes, even an \\u201cearly\\u201d stage tumor is the result of many previous, undetectable cellular and molecular changes in the body.Now, scientists at Yale School of Medicine (YSM) and their collaborators have caught a detailed glimpse of some of those earliest changes, using powerful, high-resolution microscopy to track the very first cancer-triggering physical changes in mouse skin cells.Understanding these early events could be helpful for us to actually design approaches to prevent the eventual formation of cancer.Tianchi Xin, PhDBy studying mice that carry a cancer-promoting mutation in their hair follicles, the scientists found that the earliest signs ofcancerformation happen at a precise time and place in the growth of the hair follicles of the mouse skin cells. Further, they found that those precancerous changes can be blocked with a kind of drug known as an MEK inhibitor.The team, led byTianchi Xin, PhD, research scientist in genetics at YSM;Valentina Greco, PhD, Carolyn Walch Slayman Professor of Genetics at YSM and member of the Yale Cancer Center and Yale Stem Cell Center; and Sergi Regot, PhD, associate professor of molecular biology and genetics at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine,published its results April 30in the journalNature Cell Biology.The scientists studied mice that develop cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, the second most common type of human skin cancer. These mice were genetically engineered with a cancer-promoting mutation in a gene called KRAS, which is among the mostcommonly mutatedoncogenes in human cancers. KRAS mutations have also been found to drive lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, and colorectal cancer, among others.The early change that the scientists studied \\u2014 the growth of a tiny, abnormal bump in the hair follicle \\u2014 is classified as a pre-cancerous abnormality. \\u201cUnderstanding these early events could be helpful for us to actually design approaches to prevent the eventual formation of cancer,\\u201d said Xin, who was first author on the study.Although their study focused on skin cancer, the researchers believe the principles they discovered are likely to apply to the many other kinds of cancer driven by KRAS mutations because the basic genes and proteins involved are the same across different tumors.Not just cell proliferationAs in humans, mouse hair follicles continually grow, shedding old hairs and forming new ones. Stem cells, which hold the capacity to develop into many other kinds of cells, drive much of this renewal cycle. Previous studies had found that KRAS mutations drive an increase in stem cell proliferation in hair follicles, and it was assumed this significant increase in the number of stem cells was responsible for the precancerous tissue disruption.To test this assumption, the team used a specially engineered form of mutated KRAS that they could switch on at a specific time in the animals\\u2019 hair follicle skin cells. Xin and his colleagues used a microscopy method known as intravital imaging, whose name refers to the technique\\u2019s ability to image cells at high resolution in a living animal, and to label and follow individual stem cells in the animals. When the KRAS mutation was triggered, all the stem cells proliferated faster, but the pre-cancerous bump only formed in one specific place in the hair follicle and in one stage in the growth cycle, meaning that the overall higher number of cells was likely not the whole story.Switching on the KRAS mutation in hair follicles led the stem cells to proliferate faster, change their migration patterns, and divide in different directions from cells without the cancer-promoting mutation.The mutation acts on a downstream protein known as ERK. Xin was able to observe real-time ERK activity in individual stem cells in live animals and discovered a specific change in that protein\\u2019s activity triggered by the KRAS mutation. The researchers were also able to stop the formation of the pre-cancerous bump using an MEK inhibitor, which blocks ERK\\u2019s activity. The drug halted the mutation\\u2019s effects on migration and cell orientation, but not on overall stem cell proliferation, implying that formation of the pre-cancerous condition is due to these first two changes, rather than to enhanced cell proliferation.Precancer in contextTracking the effects of an oncogenic mutation in real time, in a living animal, is the only way the researchers were able to uncover these principles. That is important because cancer does not form in a vacuum \\u2014 it is highly dependent on its microenvironment to grow and sustain itself. The scientists also needed to track not only the behavior of individual cells, but the molecules within those cells.\\u201cThe way we\\u2019ve approached understanding these oncogenic events is really to connect across scale,\\u201d Greco said. \\u201cThe framework and approaches Dr. Xin used in collaboration with Dr. Regot allowed us to go down to molecular elements while connecting them to the scale of the cell and the tissue, in a way that gives us a resolution to these events that\\u2019s so difficult to do outside a living animal.\\u201dNext, the researchers want to track the process for a longer time to see what happens after that initial bump forms. They also want to look at other cancer-promoting events like inflammation to see if the principles they discovered apply in other contexts.\"], [\"A Better COVID Treatment for the Immunocompromised?\", \"A combination of two antiviral compounds may be a promising alternative to Paxlovid when treating COVID-19 in immunocompromised patients, according toKaren S. Anderson, PhD, professor of pharmacology and of molecular biophysics & biochemistry at Yale School of Medicine.People who are infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, currently have two options approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for antiviral treatment. The more widely used medication is Paxlovid, a drug whose antiviral component, nirmatrelvir, is highly effective at reducing the severity of symptoms and decreasing hospitalizations, and may, Anderson believes, have helped save thousands of lives.However, another component of Paxlovid, ritonavir, can negatively interact with anti-rejection medications taken by immunocompromised people, most notably those who have received organ transplants. This has led some patients to be hospitalized with kidney failure after taking Paxlovid due to drug-drug interactions. Meanwhile, molnupiravir\\u2014 another antiviral for COVID-19 that has received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the FDA \\u2014 is not nearly as effective at treating the disease.Now, ina study published April 15inProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Anderson and her colleagues at Yale University have created a non-toxic potential alternative to Paxlovid by combining molnupiravir with a new antiviral compound they developed in the lab. Research scientists Christina Papini, a PhD student, and Irfan Ullah, PhD, both at Yale School of Medicine, are the first authors of the paper. Anderson is a corresponding author along with her colleagues, William Jorgensen, PhD, and Priti Kumar, PhD.The study found that humanized mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 universally  overcame the disease when treated with the new drug combination. If replicated in clinical studies, this finding could help immunocompromised people receive better treatment for COVID-19 in the future.Race toward an antiviralProgress toward the current effort at Yale to develop antivirals for COVID started with work on HIV, the virus responsible for AIDS. Anderson and her colleagues have spent much of their careers using computational and experimental methods to design better drugs that could be used to treat HIV. During the first month of lockdown in March 2020, the team wondered if they could use this same approach to find drugs to target COVID-19.\\u201cAt the time, there were really no therapies\\u201d for treating people infected with SARS-CoV-2, says Anderson. \\\"Everyone was desperate to find something.\\\"William Jorgensen, PhD, Sterling Professor of Chemistry at Yale, used computational methods to see if the structure of any existing drugs could serve as a starting point to target the main protease of SARS-CoV-2, which is essential for viral replication. The analysis revealed that the existing compound of perampanel, an FDA-approved seizure drug, could loosely bind to the main protease. From there, Jorgensen and his lab made changes in the chemical structure of the compound until they came up with preclinical candidates that might eventually work in a clinical setting.Preparing for future viral diseasesOne of these compounds of the series was Mpro61.  Priti Kumar, PhD, associate professor of internal medicine (infectious diseases) and of microbial pathogenesis, and her lab tested Mpro61 alone and combined with molnupiravir in mice that were genetically engineered to replicate the worst COVID cases in people. Promisingly, the researchers found that Mpro61 was effective at reducing viral load. But while Mpro61 helped extend mice survival, most infected animals eventually succumbed to the disease.However, when they combined Mpro61 with the existing EUA-approved antiviral molnupiravir, the one-two-punch antiviral proved highly effective \\u2014 with no noticeable traces of the virus after 14 days post-infection. All mice treated with the drug survived. By contrast, mice treated with just one antiviral showed reduced viral load but most died within 14 days post-infection.The finding suggests that a combination of the two antivirals could make for a promising alternative to Paxlovid with limited side effects. But whether this drug is taken to the next step in clinical trials may depend on whether there is interest from the pharmaceutical industry. \\u201cThe problem is that people\\u2019s attention is turned away from COVID,\\u201d says Anderson. \\u201cThey may no longer think it\\u2019s a problem.\\u201dHowever, new COVID variants continue to emerge, and the disease remains especially dangerous for people who are immunocompromised. Even with vaccines, more people die from COVID-19 today than from the flu. So, a more potent alternative to molnupiravir could be important for treating immunocompromised people infected with the disease.Other tests showed that the Mpro61 may be effective at reducing viral load for another type of coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-1, which caused the respiratory disease SARS and spread through much of Asia starting in 2002, resulting in more than 900 deaths. Given that coronaviruses are a hotbed for new diseases, having a drug on the shelf that can be used in the case of an emergent pathogen from this family could be useful, says Anderson.\\u201cWe were so caught off guard with [the COVID- 19] pandemic in terms of having something that works,\\u201d she says. \\u201cThis work might put us a step forward in future pandemics.\\u201dAdditional contributors to the work were co-authors Amalendu Ranjan, Shuo Zhang, Qihao Wu, Krasimir Spasov, Chunhui Zhang, Walther Mothes, Jason Crawford, Brett Lindenbach, and Pradeep Uchil.This research was funded in part by the National Institutes of Health.\"], [\"Curbing the Price of Novel Diabetes and Obesity Medications\", \"For years,Kasia Lipska, MD, MHS, associate professor of medicine (endocrinology) at Yale School of Medicine (YSM), has been advocating for affordable pricing of insulin, an essential \\u2014and sometimes lifesaving\\u2014drug for many individuals with diabetes. Now, she is turning her attention to a similar trend of soaring prices among new diabetes and obesity medications.The implications of exorbitant prices for these novel therapies are alarming, according to Lipska, who first became aware of the drug pricing issue in 2016 when one of her patients couldn\\u2019t afford to increase the dose of insulin she was taking. In subsequent research, Lipska discovered that 1.1 million Americans, or 14 percent of those who filled insulin prescriptions, reached catastrophic spending, defined as spending more than 40 percent of post-subsistence income on insulin alone.The same insulin and other medications for diabetes and obesity are frequently priced 10 times higher in the U.S. than in peer countries, Lipska said.In a new paper, \\u201cLessons From Insulin: Policy Prescriptions for Affordable Diabetes and Obesity Medications,\\u201d published inDiabetes Care, Lipska,Reshma Ramachandran, MD, assistant professor of medicine (general medicine) at YSM, and first author Kathryn Nagel, MD, former YSM Department of Internal Medicine resident, used findings from previous research on insulin pricing to look at the issues underlying drug affordability.Our paper highlights where along the drug development and delivery value chain there is more work yet to be done by policymakers to enable more equitable and affordable access to these medications.Reshma Ramachandran, MD\\u201cAs with insulin, our patients are facing parallel challenges in accessing other new non-insulin diabetes and anti-obesity medications,\\u201d Ramachandran said.In their research and analysis, Lipska, Ramachandran, and Nagel gathered evidence about the changes needed to achieve fair pricing of new diabetes and obesity drugs, creating a blueprint that policymakers can use for potential action.\\u201cWriting the article helped us map out the different pieces that go into the drug pricing process in the U.S.,\\u201d Lipska said. \\u201cWe learned more about the complex chain of events that leads from drug development and patent law to how much patients pay when the medicine gets to them.\\u201d\\u201cOur paper highlights where along the drug development and delivery value chain there is more work yet to be done by policymakers to enable more equitable and affordable access to these medications,\\u201d Ramachandran added.Ramachandran noted a key lesson learned from efforts to improve access to insulin is that there is no single silver bullet. \\u201cOur paper shows that a range of upstream and downstream policies are necessary,\\u201d she said.There are a lot of policies targeting drug affordability that have recently been proposed or enacted into law. Clinicians can give feedback about how certain solutions are playing out in practice and bring an important perspective to this conversation.Kasia Lipska, MD, MHSBut there are challenges to policy reform, the researchers observed.\\u201cWhile the recent Inflation Reduction Act includes several policies to lower prescription drug prices, including for those used in diabetes treatment, the legislation also has serious limitations in providing relief for patients, particularly for novel, transformative treatments,\\u201d Ramachandran said.Lipska pointed to the power of U.S. corporations as another obstacle to drug affordability. \\u201cMany patient advocacy groups, educational events, and even professional societies that clinicians are a part of are in some way influenced or supported by the pharmaceutical industry,\\u201d she said.Still, the issue is gaining traction, Lipska says. She notes a growing awareness of the need to address the drug pricing crisis through state and federal intervention and of the role clinicians can play in advocating on behalf of their patients.\\u201cThere are a lot of policies targeting drug affordability that have recently been proposed or enacted into law,\\u201d she said. \\u201cClinicians can give feedback about how certain solutions are playing out in practice and bring an important perspective to this conversation.\\u201dYale School of Medicine\\u2019sSection of Endocrinology & Metabolism works to improve the health of individuals with endocrine and metabolic diseases by advancing scientific knowledge; applying new information to patient care; and training the next generation of physicians and scientists to become leaders in the field.
