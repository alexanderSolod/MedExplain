A new study has found that neurons responsible for higher cognition express an enrichment of calcium-related proteins, which may explain their vulnerability to diseases like Alzheimer's and schizophrenia.\\\\n2. Increased calcium in these neurons is necessary for abstract thought, but excessive calcium channel activation can lead to reduced neuronal firing and hinder cognition.\\\\n3. The findings provide clues for understanding and potentially treating cognitive disorders by identifying vulnerable brain cells and the mechanisms behind their vulnerability.\\\\n\\\\nRewritten article for 5th graders:\\\\n\\\\nThe Brain's Thinking Cells and Their Calcium Connection\\\\n\\\\nScientists from Yale School of Medicine have made an exciting discovery about the brain cells that help us think and solve problems. These special cells, called neurons, are found in a part of the brain called the prefrontal cortex. The prefrontal cortex is important for things like abstract thinking and working memory.\\\\n\\\\nThe scientists found that these neurons have a lot of tiny particles called calcium inside them. Calcium helps the neurons work properly, but too much calcium can cause problems. When there's too much calcium, the neurons can't do their job as well, and it becomes harder for us to think clearly.\\\\n\\\\nThe researchers also learned that certain changes in a gene called CACNA1C can increase the risk of mental health problems like schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. This gene is responsible for making tiny doorways called calcium channels that let calcium enter the neurons.\\\\n\\\\nTo understand how this works, imagine a neuron as a house and calcium as the people living inside. The calcium channels are like the doors that let people in and out. If there are too many doors or if the doors are always open, too many people can come inside, and the house can get crowded and messy. This is similar to what happens when there's too much calcium in the neurons.\\\\n\\\\nThe scientists also discovered that as we get older or if there's inflammation in the brain, the neurons can lose their ability to keep the right amount of calcium inside. This can lead to problems like Alzheimer's disease, where the neurons start to get sick and can't work properly anymore.\\\\n\\\\nBy understanding which brain cells are most vulnerable and why, scientists hope to find better ways to protect these cells and help people with mental health problems. Just like how we take care of our houses to keep them in good shape, the researchers are working on finding ways to keep our neurons healthy and functioning well.\"], [\"How Can Artificial Intelligence Advance Medical Education and Research to Transform Patient Care?\", \"Top 3 Main Ideas:\\\\n1.

GutGPT uses trusted information, like medical guidelines and research articles, to help answer questions.\\\\n\\\\nIn the study, participants treat pretend patients with a stomach bleeding problem using made-up patient information. Each person gets to use GutGPT either through a dashboard or a chatbot to quickly find the information they need. The study wants to see how easy the tool is to use and how much people trust it compared to other ways of getting information.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Asking ChatGPT a question at home is not the same as in a medical setting,\\\" said Dr. Dennis Shung, who is leading the research. \\\"At home, you have low stakes and unlimited time. So, we need to test how clinicians will interact with this type of generative AI in a more realistic setting to understand how AI might be most useful in a clinical setting.\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThe study is helping the researchers learn how different people, like doctors, nurses, and physician assistants, use AI tools in different ways based on their jobs and experience. This information is really important for making GutGPT more helpful for each person.\\\\n\\\\nDr. Shung thinks that AI tools like GutGPT will help improve care, not replace doctors. \\\"Modern health care has already become a team sport because we recognize that not one person can have all the expertise.

Researchers have discovered that the gene Glis2 plays a central role in polycystic kidney disease (PKD) signaling.\\\\n2. The study used an unbiased approach to identify gene expression changes in PKD models, leading to the discovery of Glis2's involvement.\\\\n3. Treating models with an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) directed against Glis2 suppressed the growth of cysts, suggesting a potential new target for PKD treatment.\\\\n\\\\nRewritten article for 5th graders:\\\\n\\\\nWhat is Polycystic Kidney Disease?\\\\nPolycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a condition that runs in families. It causes fluid-filled bumps called cysts to grow on the kidneys. These cysts make the kidneys bigger and stop them from working properly. Over time, this can lead to the kidneys failing.\\\\n\\\\nScientists have known for a long time that certain genes cause PKD, but they didn't fully understand how these genes make the cysts grow. For many years, they have been trying to learn more about PKD and what makes the cysts get bigger.\\\\n\\\\nA New Discovery\\\\nRecently, a team of scientists from Yale School of Medicine made an exciting discovery. They found that a gene called Glis2 is an important part of PKD. This gene wasn't included in any of the pathways that scientists had looked at before for PKD.\\\\n\\\\nDr. Stefan Somlo, one of the lead researchers, said, \\\"Glis2 has not been suspected to be a component of the signaling pathways involved, but our research shows it's quite centrally positioned in polycystin signaling.\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThe Journey to Discovery\\\\nAbout ten years ago, Dr. Somlo's lab was studying tiny hair-like structures called cilia on cells. They found that when certain genes called polycystins were turned off in cells with cilia, PKD happened. But surprisingly, when the cilia were also turned off, PKD didn't happen, even though the polycystins were still missing. This suggested that there was something happening in the cilia that caused cysts to grow when polycystins were missing.\\\\n\\\\nBuilding on this, Chao Zhang, one of the researchers, used a technique called RNA sequencing to look for changes in gene activity in PKD models with cilia. \\\"Among these genes, most of them are not well studied and completely new to ADPKD [autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease], which makes our work very hard. On the other hand, it brought us the opportunities of finding new factors or pathways,\\\" explains Zhang. This led to the discovery of Glis2's role in PKD.\\\\n\\\\nValidating the Findings\\\\nThe researchers then focused on changes in 73 genes and chose Glis2 as the best candidate for further study. They treated models with a special molecule called an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) that targeted Glis2. They found that this treatment slowed down the growth of cysts.\\\\n\\\\nDr. Xin Tian, another researcher on the team, said, \\\"When I found that the disease progression was significantly prevented in in vivo studies, I was very excited and realized that the Glis2 can play a crucial role in further dissecting PKD signaling and enriching our understanding of mechanisms of the human ADPKD, and also could lead to developing treatments of the disease.\\\"\\\\n\\\\nNext Steps\\\\nThe next step in their research is to learn more about how Glis2 works, including how polycystin causes Glis2 to increase and what this increase does. Most importantly, they want to find out if this discovery applies to humans.\\\\n\\\\nThis study went from discovery to testing in cell cultures and animal models, and then used a potential treatment for further proof. Dr. Somlo considers this a fairly complete preclinical study.\"], [\"In Situ Microscopy Gives Atomic-level View in Native Mitochondria\", \"Top 3 main ideas:\\\\n1. A new high-resolution microscopy technique combines single-particle analysis and cryo-electron tomography to image cellular structures at an atomic level.\\\\n2. The technique allowed researchers to visualize mitochondrial respiratory supercomplexes in their native environment, revealing how they react to different conditions and diseases.\\\\n3. This groundbreaking technology could help researchers better understand the underlying mechanisms of various diseases and develop more precise, effective drugs.\\\\n\\\\nSeeing the Tiniest Details Inside Cells\\\\n\\\\nScientists have created a new way to look at the tiny parts inside cells. It's like using a super-powerful microscope that can show us things we've never seen before! This new technique combines two different types of microscopes to create pictures that are so detailed, we can even see individual atoms.\\\\n\\\\nThe researchers used this new microscope to look at special parts of cells called mitochondria. Mitochondria are like tiny power plants that give cells the energy they need to work properly. Inside mitochondria, there are groups of tiny machines called supercomplexes that help make this energy. With the new microscope, scientists were able to see these supercomplexes in great detail without having to take them out of the mitochondria.\\\\n\\\\nSeeing the Supercomplexes in Action\\\\n\\\\nBy looking at the supercomplexes in their natural environment, the researchers could see how they change shape and work together when the cell is healthy or sick. They even saw how the supercomplexes reacted to different conditions, like when the heart doesn't get enough blood flow.\\\\n\\\\nDr. Jack Zhang, the lead scientist of the study, said, \\\"Previously, our technology was not able to reveal how interactions occur. But in this case, we see the atoms, we see the structures of molecules, and we see how everything interacts.\\\" This means that the new microscope can help us understand how things work inside cells in a way we never could before.\\\\n\\\\nA New Way to Study Diseases and Create Better Medicines\\\\n\\\\nThis new microscope technology is really exciting because it can help scientists learn more about what happens inside cells when someone is sick. By looking at the tiny details, researchers can find new ways to create medicines that target the exact problem in the cell.\\\\n\\\\nThe scientists who reviewed this study said, \\\"This groundbreaking work sets new standards in structural biology,\\\" and, \\\"Future work will exploit the huge potential of this new approach.\\\" This means that the new microscope could lead to many important discoveries in the future.\\\\n\\\\nDr. Zhang and his team are already planning to use this technology to study different diseases in animals and even in human tissue samples. By looking at what's happening inside the cells of sick people, they hope to create better medicines that can help treat those diseases more effectively.\\\\n\\\\nIn conclusion, this new high-resolution microscopy technique is like a powerful new tool that can help us see the tiniest details inside cells. It could help scientists understand diseases better and create medicines that work better than ever before.\"], [\"How Can Artificial Intelligence Advance Medical Education and Research to Transform Patient Care?\", \"Top 3 Main Ideas:\\\\n1.

They tested a medication called varenicline, which is already used to help people quit smoking regular cigarettes.\\\\n\\\\nIn their study, the researchers divided people into two groups. One group received varenicline, while the other group received a placebo (a pill with no active ingredients). The results showed that 45% of the people in the medication group were able to quit using e-cigarettes, compared to only 30% in the placebo group.\\\\n\\\\nDr. Lisa Fucito, the lead author of the study, explained, \\\"People can get very high levels of nicotine from e-cigarettes, and they can use them almost constantly throughout the day. We wanted to see if any medication could help them quit.\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThe researchers designed the study to be similar to what people would experience in real life. Instead of having many counseling sessions, participants received a booklet with tips and tools for quitting, along with brief advice from a healthcare provider.\\\\n\\\\nThe study also included some people who had a history of depression. This was important because there were once concerns that varenicline might cause mental health problems. However, a large study in 2016 showed that the medication is safe.\\\\n\\\\nAnother good finding was that people who quit vaping did not go back to smoking regular cigarettes. However, the researchers discovered that people who had only ever used e-cigarettes might have a harder time quitting compared to those who had smoked cigarettes before.\\\\n\\\\nDr. Benjamin Toll, the senior author of the study, said, \\\"We need more studies with larger groups of people to better understand these questions. But this study should give doctors some confidence in prescribing varenicline to patients who want to stop using e-cigarettes.\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThe researchers believe that it's important for people to have access to this medication.

We hope that understanding this will be potentially useful as a medication in the future.\\\" In other words, if we can make medicines that work like miRNAs, we might be able to help people heal faster!\\\\n\\\\nThe Uterus: A Special Place for Stem Cells\\\\n\\\\nThe study looked at how stem cells work in the uterus, which is an organ in a woman's body where babies grow. After a woman has a baby, the uterus needs to heal and get ready for the next pregnancy. Stem cells play an important role in this process.\\\\n\\\\nThe scientists found that certain miRNAs helped the cells in the uterus grow and multiply. They also discovered that these molecules stopped the cells from changing in a way that prepares the uterus for a baby. This is important because when cells change like this, they can't repair themselves as easily.\\\\n\\\\nFuture Medicines for Healing\\\\n\\\\nThe researchers hope that by learning more about miRNAs, they can create new medicines to help people heal from injuries or diseases. For example, some women have a condition called Asherman syndrome, where their uterus gets damaged and can't heal properly. This can make it hard for them to have a baby. Dr. Taylor thinks that miRNAs could be used as a treatment to help the uterus heal in these cases.\\\\n\\\\nThe study's findings could also be important for other parts of the body, not just the uterus. The scientists plan to keep studying how miRNAs work in animals when they get hurt. They believe that this research could lead to new treatments for many different kinds of injuries and diseases.\\\\n\\\\nIn conclusion, stem cells are like tiny healers in our bodies, and the miRNAs they produce are their secret weapons. By understanding how these molecules work, scientists hope to create new medicines that can help people heal faster and better. It's exciting to think about all the ways this research could help people in the future!\"], [\"Yale Begins 3D Orthopaedic Surgical Procedures That Are Fully In-house\", \"Top 3 main ideas:\\\\n1. Yale has performed its first fully in-house 3D surgical case, using advanced imaging software, 3D modeling, and 3D printing to repair a distal radius malunion.\\\\n2. The 3D Collaborative for Medical Innovation (3DC) at Yale offers patient-specific solutions, leading to benefits such as reduced operating times, enhanced precision, and better patient outcomes.\\\\n3. Yale has created the nation's first master's degree in personalized medicine and applied engineering to train the next generation of professionals in using 3D technology in medicine.\\\\n\\\\n<h2>A New Era of Personalized Medicine at Yale</h2>\\\\n\\\\nDr. Lisa Lattanza, a top orthopaedic surgeon, has done something amazing at Yale School of Medicine. She performed the first-ever surgery there using 3D technology from start to finish. This means that everything was planned and made just for the patient, like a custom-made outfit!\\\\n\\\\nThe patient had a problem with their forearm bone that didn't heal correctly after a break. It was causing pain and making it hard for them to move their wrist normally. Dr. Lattanza worked with a team at Yale to create a special plan for the surgery using 3D models of the patient's bones. They even 3D printed guides to help during the operation.\\\\n\\\\nDr. Lattanza explains, \\\"In orthopaedic surgery, we want to help patients get back to their normal lives. We can't just use a 'one size fits all' approach anymore.\\\" She says that every person is unique, with their own anatomy, movements, and injuries. That's why 3D surgical procedures are made specifically for each patient.\\\\n\\\\n<h2>Seeing Bones in 3D</h2>\\\\n\\\\nIn the past, surgeons had to look at flat X-ray images, which made it hard to understand the exact shape and position of the bones. But now, with 3D technology, they can see everything clearly before even making a cut. This makes the surgery safer and more precise.\\\\n\\\\nEngineers use special software to turn CT or MRI scans into digital 3D models of the bones. Surgeons can then plan the surgery using these models. It's like having a map before going on a trip! This technology is especially helpful when fixing previous surgeries that didn't solve the patient's problem.\\\\n\\\\n<h2>3D Printing for Orthopaedic Surgery</h2>\\\\n\\\\nYale has a special team called the 3D Collaborative for Medical Innovation (3DC) that helps surgeons create 3D printed models and tools for their patients. These exact copies of the patient's bones let surgeons practice and see how everything will fit together before the actual surgery. It's like having a practice run!\\\\n\\\\nAlyssa Glennon, the leader of the 3DC team, says, \\\"Our main goal is to support our doctors by bringing engineering skills into their surgical planning and using cool technology like 3D printing, artificial intelligence, and virtual reality in the operating room.\\\" She explains that having an in-house team means they can work closely with the doctors, make quick changes, and help more types of patients.\\\\n\\\\n<h2>The First In-House 3D Surgery at Yale</h2>\\\\n\\\\nThe patient who had Dr. Lattanza's first 3D surgery had an injury that made it hard for them to move their wrist and caused pain. To fix this, Dr. Lattanza and Alyssa worked together to make a custom plan. They used the patient's healthy arm as a guide to figure out exactly how to fix the injured one.\\\\n\\\\nDuring the surgery, Dr. Lattanza cut the bones and moved them into the right position, just like they planned. She used 3D printed guides and models to make sure everything was perfect. The patient's wrist joint was fully restored, and they can now move it normally again.\\\\n\\\\n<h2>The Future of Personalized Medicine</h2>\\\\n\\\\nThe 3DC team is excited to help doctors in many different areas of medicine, not just orthopaedics. They want to offer the best patient experience possible and help surgeons achieve what seems impossible.\\\\n\\\\nDr. Lattanza and Alyssa also helped create a special college program at Yale to teach the next generation of doctors and engineers how to use 3D technology in medicine. It's the first program of its kind in the whole country!\\\\n\\\\nDr. Lattanza believes that this technology will change the way we treat patients and educate future doctors. She says, \\\"It is also a powerful learning and research tool that is breaking down\"], [\"Investigating the Link Between Metabolism and Cancer\", \"Main Ideas:\\\\n1. Insulin plays a key role in regulating glucose uptake into tumors, and individuals with obesity and insulin resistance may be at a higher risk of developing certain types of cancer.\\\\n2. Low-carbohydrate diets and exercise can be beneficial in reducing the risk of developing metabolism-related cancers.\\\\n3. Researchers are working on repurposing metabolic drugs used for diabetes or obesity to potentially improve cancer treatment and develop precision medicine approaches.\\\\n\\\\nRewritten Article for 5th Grade Audience:\\\\n\\\\nThe Link Between Insulin and Cancer\\\\n\\\\nHave you ever wondered how the food we eat and the energy we use can affect our health? Dr. Rachel Perry, a scientist at Yale University, is studying how these factors can impact a serious disease called cancer.\\\\n\\\\nWhat Is Insulin and How Does It Relate to Cancer?\\\\n\\\\nOur bodies need a type of sugar called glucose for energy. When we eat, a special hormone called insulin helps our cells take in glucose from the food. However, sometimes cells don't respond well to insulin, which is called insulin resistance. When this happens, the body makes more insulin to help the cells take in glucose.\\\\n\\\\nDr. Perry explains that cancer cells divide quickly and need a lot of glucose to grow. Insulin tells cancer cells to take in more glucose, just like it tells other cells in the body. The problem is that when a person has insulin resistance, their cancer cells continue to take in more glucose while other cells don't. This means that more glucose goes into the cancer cells, helping them grow.\\\\n\\\\nCan We Reduce the Risk of Getting These Types of Cancer?\\\\n\\\\nStudies have shown that eating a diet low in carbohydrates (which turn into glucose in the body) and exercising regularly can help lower the risk of getting these types of cancer.\\\\n\\\\nA Surprising Finding\\\\n\\\\nDr. Perry and her team did a study using a drug called dichloroacetate, which helps cells use glucose better. They thought this drug could improve how well immunotherapy (a type of cancer treatment) works. While the drug didn't slow cancer growth, they found that it helped reduce cancer-related fatigue, which is a feeling of extreme tiredness that many cancer patients experience.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Ninety percent of patients with cancer report substantial fatigue that impairs their quality of life and reduces the probability that they will complete cancer treatment,\\\" Dr. Perry explains. \\\"Currently, there are no effective medications for this debilitating condition. We hope that this drug can potentially help these patients.\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThe Future of Treatment\\\\n\\\\nDr. Perry and her team are working to better understand how the way our bodies use energy affects how our immune system responds to cancer and how cancer cells use energy. They hope to use drugs that are already used for diabetes or obesity to improve cancer treatment.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"We showed in a paper published a couple of years ago that in various breast cancer preclinical models, depending on the tumor genetics, different models respond better to insulin-lowering therapies,\\\" Dr. Perry says. \\\"That research opens the possibility of developing precision medicine-type approaches to use metabolic therapy for cancer. That's our goal moving on.\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThe Yale School of Medicine's Section of Endocrinology and Metabolism is working hard to improve the health of people with hormone and metabolic diseases by advancing scientific knowledge, applying new information to patient care, and training the next generation of doctors and scientists to become leaders in the field.\"], [\"A New Kind of Clinical Trial: Bringing Long COVID Research Into Patients\\u2019 Homes\", \"Top 3 main ideas:\\\\n1. Decentralized clinical trials, like the Yale Paxlovid for Long COVID (PAX LC) Trial, make participation more accessible for patients with debilitating conditions by bringing the research into their homes.\\\\n2. The current structure of standard clinical trials hinders scientific progress and innovation due to slow enrollment and lack of diversity among participants.\\\\n3. New technologies and a participant-centric approach can make decentralized trials more efficient and cost-effective, potentially revolutionizing the future of clinical research across various fields.\\\\n\\\\nRewritten article for 5th-grade audience:\\\\n\\\\nLiving with Long COVID Can Make It Hard to Join Medical Studies\\\\nImagine having a disease that makes you so tired, it feels like your arms and legs weigh a million pounds. That's what happened to Cindy, a mom in Texas who got sick with COVID-19 in 2020. Even after she got better, she still felt exhausted and had trouble breathing. Cindy has something called Long COVID, which means her symptoms didn't go away even after the virus was gone.\\\\n\\\\nCindy wanted to help doctors find a treatment for Long COVID, but it was hard for her to join a medical study. Many studies require people to visit a hospital or clinic, which can be tough when you're not feeling well. Luckily, a new kind of study called the Yale Paxlovid for Long COVID (PAX LC) Trial is making it easier for people like Cindy to participate.\\\\n\\\\nA New Way to Do Medical Studies\\\\nDr. Harlan Krumholz and his team at Yale University designed the PAX LC Trial to test a medicine called Paxlovid for treating Long COVID. Instead of making people come to a hospital, they sent the medicine right to the participants' homes. People in the study could give blood and saliva samples at home or at a nearby lab, and they answered questions about their symptoms using an app on their phone.\\\\n\\\\nThis new approach is called a decentralized trial, and it helps people who might not be able to join a regular study because of their health, distance from a hospital, or other reasons. Dr. Krumholz believes that decentralized trials can make medical research faster and more efficient, which means new treatments could reach patients sooner.\\\\n\\\\nWhy Medical Studies Need to Change\\\\nRight now, many medical studies take a long time to find enough people to participate. This slows down the discovery of new treatments. Dr. Krumholz says that the current way of doing things can make people feel like they don't want to join or stay in a study, even if it could help them.\\\\n\\\\nHe suggests that medical studies should treat participants as partners and make it easier for them to join. The PAX LC Trial did this by working around people's schedules and creating a sense of community through virtual meetings where participants could ask questions and learn about the study's progress.\\\\n\\\\nMaking Medical Studies Easier with Technology\\\\nNew technologies are making decentralized trials like PAX LC possible. For example, Dr. Krumholz co-founded a company called Hugo Health that helps people share their medical records with researchers more easily. This means that researchers don't have to go through a complicated process to get the information they need from a patient's doctor.\\\\n\\\\nEven though sending people to participants' homes might seem expensive, Dr. Krumholz says that the PAX LC Trial actually cost less than a regular study. This is because they didn't have to set up study sites across the country, which can be very costly and time-consuming.\\\\n\\\\nA Brighter Future for Medical Research\\\\nThe success of the PAX LC Trial shows that decentralized studies can work for many different kinds of research, not just Long COVID. By making it easier for people to participate and using new technologies, researchers can find answers to important health questions more quickly.\\\\n\\\\nDr. Krumholz hopes that the PAX LC Trial will inspire other researchers to create studies that put participants first. He believes that this approach could lead to a brighter future for medical research, where new treatments and cures are discovered faster than ever before.\"], [\"Beyond Weight Loss: Five Yale Experts on the Benefits of Exercise\", \"Top 3 main ideas:\\\\n1. Exercise provides numerous health benefits beyond physical fitness and cardiovascular health.\\\\n2. Regular physical activity can help prevent and manage various diseases, including diabetes, infections, and sleep disorders.\\\\n3. Exercise positively impacts the immune system, gut health, and circadian rhythm.\\\\n\\\\nRewritten article for 5th graders:\\\\n\\\\nThe Incredible Benefits of Exercise\\\\nDid you know that exercise is like a superpower for your body? It can make your muscles stronger, help you lose extra fat, and keep your heart healthy. But that's not all! Experts from Yale School of Medicine have discovered that exercise has many other amazing benefits.\\\\n\\\\nBeating Insulin Resistance\\\\nDr. Gerald I. Shulman and his team found that exercise can help your body use a special hormone called insulin better. When your body doesn't use insulin well, it can lead to health problems like diabetes, fatty liver disease, heart disease, and even some types of cancer. Dr. Shulman says that exercising every day is important for keeping your body healthy.\\\\n\\\\nHelping You Recover from Infections\\\\nDr. Scott Roberts explains that exercise can also help you fight off infections like the flu, COVID-19, and RSV. When you exercise regularly, your body is better prepared to handle these germs and recover faster if you do get sick.\\\\n\\\\nBoosting Your Immune System\\\\nDr. Elise Liu says that light exercise, like walking or jogging, can make your immune system work better. People who exercise regularly tend to get sick less often than people who don't move around much. This might be because exercise helps certain cells in your immune system do their job better.\\\\n\\\\nKeeping Your Gut Happy\\\\nDr. Avlin Imaeda has found that exercise can make the tiny living things in your gut (called the microbiome) more diverse and increase a special substance called butyrate. Butyrate helps the cells in your gut stay healthy and can reduce the risk of certain diseases like inflammatory bowel disease and colon cancer.\\\\n\\\\nImproving Your Sleep\\\\nDr. Brienne Miner explains that exercising during the day can help you sleep better at night. Exercise is like a message to your body's internal clock, telling it when it's time to be awake and when it's time to sleep. When your internal clock is working well, you can enjoy more restful sleep and better overall health.\\\\n\\\\nSo, as you can see, exercise is not just about being strong and fast. It's a powerful tool that can help your body in many different ways.

Larger trials are needed to further investigate the effectiveness of varenicline for e-cigarette cessation, particularly among those who have only ever used e-cigarettes.\\\\n\\\\nRewritten Article for 5th Graders:\\\\n\\\\nA New Way to Help People Quit E-Cigarettes\\\\n\\\\nResearchers from Yale Cancer Center and the Hollings Cancer Center have found a promising way to help adults stop using e-cigarettes. They tested a medication called varenicline, which is already used to help people quit smoking regular cigarettes.\\\\n\\\\nIn their study, the researchers divided people into two groups. One group received varenicline, while the other group received a placebo (a pill with no active ingredients). The results showed that 45% of the people in the medication group were able to quit using e-cigarettes, compared to only 30% in the placebo group.\\\\n\\\\nDr. Lisa Fucito, the lead author of the study, explained, \\\"People can get very high levels of nicotine from e-cigarettes, and they can use them almost constantly throughout the day.

Instead of having many counseling sessions, participants received a booklet with tips and tools for quitting, along with brief advice from a healthcare provider.\\\\n\\\\nThe study also included some people who had a history of depression. This was important because there were once concerns that varenicline might cause mental health problems. However, a large study in 2016 showed that the medication is safe.\\\\n\\\\nAnother good finding was that people who quit vaping did not go back to smoking regular cigarettes. However, the researchers discovered that people who had only ever used e-cigarettes might have a harder time quitting compared to those who had smoked cigarettes before.\\\\n\\\\nDr. Benjamin Toll, the senior author of the study, said, \\\"We need more studies with larger groups of people to better understand these questions. But this study should give doctors some confidence in prescribing varenicline to patients who want to stop using e-cigarettes.\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThe researchers believe that it's important for people to have access to this medication. Dr. Fucito explained, \\\"There are people who need help now and are likely to struggle to quit e-cigarettes on their own because the technology makes it so easy to use nicotine at levels we've never seen before.\\\"\"], [\"Search for Affordable Treatment Option for Liver Disease\", \"Main Ideas:\\\\n1. Metabolic-associated steatolic liver disease (MASLD) is a common chronic liver disease affecting nearly one-third of adults in the U.S. and worldwide.\\\\n2. The FDA recently approved the first therapy for metabolic steatohepatitis (MASH), a severe form of MASLD, but there is still a need for affordable, generic treatment options.\\\\n3. Dr. Bubu Banini received an NIH grant to investigate the potential of digoxin, an inexpensive and widely available drug, as a treatment for MASH.\\\\n\\\\nRewritten Article:\\\\n\\\\n<h2>A Common Liver Disease</h2>\\\\n\\\\nMetabolic-associated steatolic liver disease, or MASLD for short, is a health problem that affects many grown-ups in the United States and around the world. In fact, almost one out of every three adults has this condition. MASLD is a type of liver disease that is becoming more and more common.\\\\n\\\\nSome people with MASLD have a more serious form called metabolic steatohepatitis, or MASH. When someone has MASH, their liver gets worse faster and can lead to even bigger health problems.\\\\n\\\\n<h2>A New Treatment, but It's Expensive</h2>\\\\n\\\\nUntil recently, there weren't any medicines to treat MASLD. Doctors would tell patients to lose weight, which can help reduce the amount of fat in their liver. However, losing weight is hard for many people, and they didn't have any other options.\\\\n\\\\nIn March 2024, a new medicine called Rezdiffra\\u2122 was approved to treat MASH. This is the first medicine that can help people with this serious liver problem. But there's a catch \\u2013 this new medicine is very expensive. Many people who need it might not be able to afford it.\\\\n\\\\n<h2>Searching for an Affordable Solution</h2>\\\\n\\\\nDr. Bubu Banini, a doctor and researcher at Yale School of Medicine, wants to find a more affordable way to treat MASH. She received a big grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to study a medicine called digoxin.\\\\n\\\\nDigoxin is a medicine that has been used for a long time to help people with heart problems. It's much cheaper than the new medicine for MASH, and it's easy to find. Dr. Banini thinks that digoxin might also help people with MASH by reducing inflammation and scarring in their liver.\\\\n\\\\n<h2>Testing the Idea</h2>\\\\n\\\\nDr. Banini is planning a study to test if digoxin can help patients with MASH. In the study, some patients will get digoxin, while others will get a placebo (a pill that looks like the medicine but doesn't have any real medicine in it). After 24 weeks, the patients will have a special test to see if the digoxin helped their liver.\\\\n\\\\nDr. Banini is excited to do this research because digoxin has been used for a long time, so doctors already know a lot about how safe it is. This means she can focus on finding out if it works for MASH without spending years developing a brand-new medicine.\\\\n\\\\n<h2>The Importance of Research</h2>\\\\n\\\\nDr. Banini says that Yale's support for research is really important for her work. \\\"There aren't many places where you can get so much support, mentorship, and resources for research,\\\" she said.

If you have trouble breathing that doesn't go away.\\\\nDr. Geoffrey Chupp, a lung doctor at Yale, says that feeling short of breath can make it hard to live a normal life and exercise. It can be a sign of different lung problems or even heart issues. A pulmonologist can figure out what's causing the problem and help you feel better.\\\\n\\\\n2. If you keep getting chest infections or have a cough that won't go away.\\\\nDr. Ashley Losier, another lung doctor at Yale, explains that people who get a lot of chest infections or have a cough that lasts a long time might have something wrong with their lungs. A pulmonologist can help find out what's wrong and give you the right treatment.\\\\n\\\\n3. If an X-ray or CT scan shows spots on your lungs.\\\\nSometimes, when doctors take pictures of your lungs, they might see spots called nodules. Most of the time, these spots are just scars, but sometimes they can be a sign of a lung disease, infection, or even cancer. A pulmonologist can help figure out what the spots mean.\\\\n\\\\n4. If you feel very sleepy during the day or snore loudly at night.\\\\nDr. Klar Yaggi, a sleep doctor at Yale, says that problems with breathing while you sleep can be bad for your heart and overall health. Pulmonologists can find out if you have a sleep disorder and help you get better sleep.\\\\n\\\\n5. If you have blocked blood vessels in your lungs.\\\\nDr. Akhil Khosla, another lung doctor at Yale, explains that pulmonologists can help patients who have a condition called pulmonary embolism, which is when blood vessels in the lungs get blocked. This can make people very sick, so it's important to get help from a pulmonologist.\\\\n\\\\n<h2>How Yale's Lung Doctors Help Patients</h2>\\\\n\\\\nThe lung doctors at Yale are some of the best in the country. They use the latest research and treatments to help patients with all kinds of lung problems. Dr. Naftali Kaminski, the head of Yale's lung department, says that the most important thing is that the doctors really care about their patients and work closely with other doctors to make sure everyone gets the best care possible.\\\\n\\\\nYale has many special programs for different lung diseases, like cystic fibrosis, COPD, lung infections, and more. They even have a special center just for studying and treating lung diseases.\"], [\"Building Capacity in Medical Students to Care for Transgender and Gender Diverse Patients\", \"Top 3 main ideas:\\\\n1. Yale medical and public health students collaborated with faculty mentors to develop a clinical skills-based simulation session on caring for transgender and gender diverse patients.\\\\n2. The initiative aimed to address the lack of sufficient training for medical students to provide adequate health care to transgender and gender diverse individuals.\\\\n3. The training session was successfully piloted and will become a permanent part of the precede curriculum for all MD and MD-PhD clerkship students at Yale School of Medicine.\\\\n\\\\nRewritten article for 5th graders:\\\\n\\\\n<h2>Yale Students Help Doctors Learn to Care for Transgender Patients</h2>\\\\n\\\\n<p>A group of students at Yale School of Medicine wanted to help doctors learn how to take better care of transgender and gender diverse patients. Transgender people are those who identify with a gender different from the one they were assigned at birth. Gender diverse people may not identify as either male or female.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>The students found out that many doctors felt uncomfortable treating transgender and gender diverse patients because they didn't have enough training. This can make it hard for these patients to get the care they need.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>To help solve this problem, the students worked with their teachers to create a special class. In this class, doctors-in-training would practice talking to and caring for transgender and gender diverse patients. They would learn how to make these patients feel safe and respected.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>The students asked people from the transgender and gender diverse community to help with the class. These volunteers would pretend to be patients so the doctors-in-training could practice what they learned.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>The special class was tested with a small group of students, and it worked really well. Now, all students at Yale School of Medicine will take this class before they start working in hospitals.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>The students who created the class hope that it will help future doctors feel more confident and prepared to care for transgender and gender diverse patients. They believe that everyone deserves to get good health care, no matter who they are.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>By teaching doctors how to better serve this community, the students are helping to make sure that transgender and gender diverse people can get the care they need without feeling afraid or uncomfortable.</p>\"], [\"Celebrating Health Profession Students' Poetry, Prose, and Visual Arts \", \"Main Ideas:\\\\n1. The Yale School of Medicine Program for Humanities in Medicine held its annual Health Professions Students' Creative Writing & Art Contest, celebrating student winners who shared their creations.\\\\n2. The contest, which began over 20 years ago, has expanded to include visual arts and students from various health profession schools and programs at Yale.\\\\n3. The student winners shared personal stories and inspirations behind their winning pieces, highlighting the therapeutic value of art and the importance of self-expression in their lives and medical training.\\\\n\\\\nRewritten Article:\\\\n\\\\nCelebrating Creativity in Medicine\\\\n\\\\nEvery year, the Yale School of Medicine holds a special contest for students in health professions. It's called the Health Professions Students' Creative Writing & Art Contest, and it's been going on for over 20 years! The contest started as a way for medical students to share their poetry and prose, but now it includes visual arts too. Students from different health programs at Yale, like nursing and public health, can also participate.\\\\n\\\\nThis year, almost 100 students entered the contest. On May 2, the winners got together to celebrate and share their creations. The audience clapped and cheered after each presentation.\\\\n\\\\nOne of the winners was Lenique Huggins, a second-year medical student. She created a piece called \\\"Black Motherhood in Medicine.\\\" Lenique was inspired by something she learned in her first week of medical school - that Black mothers are more likely to face health problems during pregnancy than white mothers. She also heard her classmates talk about their worries about being a mother while training to be a doctor. Lenique grew up surrounded by art and culture, and she believes that art can help people feel better during tough times.\\\\n\\\\nAnother winner was Hang Nguyen, who started painting when she moved to America from Vietnam at age 11. She didn't speak English then, so art helped her express herself. Hang painted a piece called \\\"Submerged\\\" for the contest. It shows her feelings while studying for important exams, using water and fish in a peaceful setting.\\\\n\\\\nKelly Dunn, a first-year Physician Associate student, won three prizes! She started writing during the COVID-19 pandemic and finds it helpful to process everything that happens in PA school. Kelly says that every day, she feels wonder, humility, and gratitude for the moments she witnesses.\\\\n\\\\nThe contest judges were 16 faculty and staff members from the Yale School of Medicine. They helped make this celebration of creativity in medicine possible.\"], [\"Investigating the Link Between Metabolism and Cancer\", \"Main Ideas:\\\\n1. Insulin plays a key role in regulating glucose uptake into tumors, and individuals with obesity and insulin resistance may be at a higher risk of developing certain types of cancer.\\\\n2. Low-carbohydrate diets and exercise can be beneficial in reducing the risk of developing metabolism-related cancers.\\\\n3. Researchers are working on repurposing metabolic drugs used for diabetes or obesity to potentially improve cancer treatment and develop precision medicine approaches.\\\\n\\\\nRewritten Article for 5th Grade Audience:\\\\n\\\\nThe Link Between Insulin and Cancer\\\\n\\\\nHave you ever wondered how the food we eat and the energy we use can affect our health? Dr. Rachel Perry, a scientist at Yale University, is studying how these factors can impact a serious disease called cancer.\\\\n\\\\nWhat Is Insulin and How Does It Relate to Cancer?\\\\n\\\\nOur bodies need a type of sugar called glucose for energy. When we eat, a special hormone called insulin helps our cells take in glucose from the food. However, sometimes cells don't respond well to insulin, which is called insulin resistance. When this happens, the body makes more insulin to help the cells take in glucose.\\\\n\\\\nCancer cells grow and divide very quickly, and they need a lot of glucose to do this. Insulin tells cancer cells to take in glucose, just like it tells other cells in the body. The problem is that cancer cells don't become insulin resistant like other cells do. So, when a person has insulin resistance, their cancer cells can take in more glucose than normal cells, which can make the cancer grow faster.\\\\n\\\\nCan We Lower the Risk of Getting These Types of Cancer?\\\\n\\\\nDr. Perry and other scientists have found that eating a diet with fewer carbohydrates (which turn into glucose in the body) and exercising regularly can help lower the risk of getting these types of cancer.\\\\n\\\\nAn Unexpected Discovery\\\\n\\\\nDr. Perry's team did a study using a drug called dichloroacetate, which helps cells use glucose better. They thought this drug might help a type of cancer treatment called immunotherapy work better. Although the drug didn't slow down cancer growth, they found that it helped reduce cancer-related fatigue, which is a feeling of extreme tiredness that many cancer patients experience. This was a surprising finding, and Dr. Perry's team hopes that this drug can help patients feel better during cancer treatment.\\\\n\\\\nThe Future of Treating Metabolism-Related Cancers\\\\n\\\\nDr. Perry and her team are working to better understand how the way our bodies use energy affects the immune system's response to cancer and how cancer cells use energy. They hope to use drugs that are already used for treating diabetes or obesity to improve cancer treatment.\\\\n\\\\nIn the future, doctors might be able to choose the best treatment for each patient based on the specific characteristics of their cancer. This is called precision medicine, and it could help more people survive cancer.\"], [\"COVID-19: New \\u2018Omics\\u2019 Models Show Why Some People Are at Greater Risk of Severe Disease, Death\", \"Main Ideas:\\\\n1. A new study has identified clues to help predict who is at risk for severe COVID-19 and who is most likely to survive among critically ill patients.\\\\n2. The study used a multi-omics approach, combining genomics, proteomics, and transcriptomics, to analyze immune responses of over 1,000 patients across the country.\\\\n3. The researchers identified factors associated with severe COVID-19 disease trajectory and mortality, including inflammation, T cell lymphopenia, tryptophan catabolism, and discoordination of interferon signaling.\\\\n\\\\nRewritten Article for 5th Grade Audience:\\\\n\\\\nWhy Do Some People Get Really Sick from COVID-19?\\\\n\\\\nScientists have been working hard to understand why some people who get COVID-19 only have a mild case, like a little sniffle, while others get very sick and need to go to the hospital. They also want to know why some people who are very sick in the hospital get better, but others do not.\\\\n\\\\nA new study has found some clues to help doctors predict who might get really sick from COVID-19 and who is most likely to survive if they do get very sick. The study looked at information from over 1,000 patients across the country.\\\\n\\\\nThe scientists studied many different parts of the patients' immune systems, which help fight off germs like the virus that causes COVID-19. They looked at samples from when the patients were in the hospital and for up to a year after they went home. This helped the scientists better understand how COVID-19 affects people differently.\\\\n\\\\nThe researchers used special computer programs to look for patterns in the patients' immune systems that might be linked to how sick they got from COVID-19. They found some important signs that could tell doctors if a person is more likely to get very sick:\\\\n\\\\n1. Inflammation: When the body's immune system is working too hard to fight the virus.\\\\n2. T cell lymphopenia: When there aren't enough of a certain type of immune cell called T cells.\\\\n3. Tryptophan catabolism: When the body breaks down an amino acid called tryptophan in a certain way.\\\\n\\\\nAmong the patients who were very sick in the hospital, the scientists also found that if their interferon signaling was not working properly, they were more likely to die from COVID-19. Interferons are important for helping the immune system fight viruses.\\\\n\\\\nThis study is a big step in understanding why COVID-19 affects people differently. The scientists hope to use what they've learned to help find better ways to treat people who get very sick from COVID-19, both while they are in the hospital and after they go home if they have lingering symptoms.\"], [\"In the Early Steps of Cancer Formation, Timing Matters\", \"Main Ideas:\\\\n1. Scientists have discovered the earliest physical changes that lead to cancer formation in mouse skin cells using high-resolution microscopy.\\\\n2. The formation of a pre-cancerous bump in hair follicles is triggered by a specific change in ERK protein activity, rather than just increased cell proliferation.\\\\n3. Tracking the effects of cancer-promoting mutations in living animals is crucial for understanding how cancer develops in the context of its microenvironment.\\\\n\\\\nRewritten Article for 5th Graders:\\\\n\\\\nCatching Cancer Before It Starts\\\\n\\\\nImagine you're playing hide-and-seek with your friends. Cancer is like a sneaky player that hides really well. By the time you find it, it has already been hiding for a long time. Scientists at Yale School of Medicine and their friends have found a way to spot cancer's hiding places before it gets too good at hiding.\\\\n\\\\nThe scientists studied mice that can get a type of skin cancer. These mice have a special change in their hair that makes them more likely to get cancer. The scientists used a powerful microscope to look closely at the mouse skin cells and follow what happens when the cancer-causing change is turned on.\\\\n\\\\nThey discovered that the very first signs of cancer happen at a specific time and place in the hair's growth. It's like finding out that the sneaky player always hides in the same spot at the beginning of the game. The scientists also found that they could stop these early changes using a special medicine.\\\\n\\\\nDr. Tianchi Xin, one of the scientists, said, \\\"Understanding these early events could be helpful for us to actually design approaches to prevent the eventual formation of cancer.\\\" In other words, if we know where cancer likes to hide, we can stop it before it gets too good at the game.\\\\n\\\\nThe scientists believe that what they learned about skin cancer in mice could also be true for other types of cancer in humans. It's like realizing that the sneaky player uses the same hiding tricks in different games.\\\\n\\\\nWatching Cancer Grow\\\\n\\\\nTo really understand how cancer starts, the scientists needed to watch it grow in a living animal. It's like trying to figure out how a plant grows by watching it every day, instead of just looking at pictures of it.\\\\n\\\\nThey used a special microscope to look at individual cells in the mice and follow what happens inside those cells when the cancer-causing change is turned on. They saw that the cells started to grow faster, move differently, and divide in unusual ways.\\\\n\\\\nThe scientists also found that they could stop these changes using a medicine that blocks a specific protein in the cells. It's like finding the secret switch that makes the sneaky player stop hiding.\\\\n\\\\nLooking to the Future\\\\n\\\\nNow that the scientists have found cancer's early hiding spots, they want to keep watching to see what happens next. They also want to look for other things that might help cancer hide, like when the body gets hurt or sick.\\\\n\\\\nBy understanding how cancer starts and grows, scientists can come up with better ways to stop it before it gets too strong. It's like figuring out all the best strategies to win at hide-and-seek every time.\"], [\"A Better COVID Treatment for the Immunocompromised?\", \"Top 3 main ideas:\\\\n1. A combination of two antiviral compounds, Mpro61 and molnupiravir, may be a promising alternative to Paxlovid for treating COVID-19 in immunocompromised patients.\\\\n2. The study found that humanized mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 overcame the disease when treated with the new drug combination, suggesting its potential effectiveness.\\\\n3. The development of this drug combination may help prepare for future viral diseases, especially those caused by coronaviruses.\\\\n\\\\nRewritten article for 5th graders:\\\\n\\\\nA New Way to Treat COVID-19 in People with Weak Immune Systems\\\\n\\\\nScientists have discovered a new way to treat COVID-19 in people who have weak immune systems. These people, called immunocompromised patients, often have a hard time fighting off diseases because their bodies can't protect them as well as they should.\\\\n\\\\nRight now, there are two main medicines that doctors can give to people who have COVID-19. One is called Paxlovid, which works really well for most people but can cause problems for immunocompromised patients who have had organ transplants. The other medicine, called molnupiravir, doesn't work as well at treating the disease.\\\\n\\\\nKaren S. Anderson, a scientist at Yale School of Medicine, and her team have found a new solution. They combined molnupiravir with a new medicine they made in their lab. When they tested this combination in mice that had COVID-19, all the mice got better and the virus went away completely.\\\\n\\\\nChristina Papini, a student scientist, and Irfan Ullah, another scientist, were the main people who worked on this study. They hope that this new medicine combination can help immunocompromised people get better treatment for COVID-19 in the future.\\\\n\\\\nThe scientists started working on this problem back in March 2020, when the pandemic first started. They used what they knew about HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, to help them find a way to fight COVID-19.\\\\n\\\\nWilliam Jorgensen, another scientist at Yale, used computers to look at existing medicines and see if any of them could be changed to work against the virus that causes COVID-19. He found one medicine, called perampanel, that they could use as a starting point. Then, they changed the medicine until they made a new one called Mpro61.\\\\n\\\\nPriti Kumar, another scientist at Yale, tested Mpro61 alone and combined with molnupiravir in mice that had COVID-19. When they gave the mice both medicines together, the virus went away completely, and all the mice survived.\\\\n\\\\nThis new medicine combination could be a good choice for immunocompromised people who can't take Paxlovid. It might also help us be better prepared for future diseases caused by viruses similar to the one that causes COVID-19.\\\\n\\\\nEven though many people are not thinking about COVID-19 as much anymore, it's still important to find better ways to treat the disease, especially for people with weak immune systems. This new discovery could be a big step forward in helping those people stay healthy.\"], [\"Curbing the Price of Novel Diabetes and Obesity Medications\", \"Top 3 Main Ideas:\\\\n1. High prices of diabetes and obesity medications in the U.S. are making them unaffordable for many patients.\\\\n2. Researchers have analyzed the issues behind drug affordability and proposed policy changes to improve access to these medications.\\\\n3. Clinicians can play a role in advocating for their patients and providing feedback on how policy solutions are working in practice.\\\\n\\\\nRewritten Article for 5th Grade Audience:\\\\n\\\\nThe High Cost of Diabetes and Obesity Medications\\\\n\\\\nImagine having a disease that requires you to take a medicine every day to stay healthy. Now, imagine that the medicine costs so much that you can't afford to buy it. This is a problem that many people with diabetes and obesity face in the United States.\\\\n\\\\nDr. Kasia Lipska, a doctor at Yale School of Medicine, has been working to make insulin, a medicine that helps people with diabetes, more affordable. She discovered that many Americans have to spend a lot of their money just to buy insulin.\\\\n\\\\nIn the United States, insulin and other medicines for diabetes and obesity often cost 10 times more than in other countries. This means that people in the U.S. have to pay much more for the same medicines.\\\\n\\\\nDr. Lipska, along with Dr. Reshma Ramachandran and Dr. Kathryn Nagel, wrote a paper to look at why these medicines cost so much. They wanted to find ways to make the prices fairer so that more people can afford them.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"As with insulin, our patients are facing parallel challenges in accessing other new non-insulin diabetes and anti-obesity medications,\\\" Dr. Ramachandran said.\\\\n\\\\nThe doctors learned that there are many steps involved in making and selling medicines in the U.S. They believe that changes need to be made at different points in this process to make the medicines more affordable.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"Our paper highlights where along the drug development and delivery value chain there is more work yet to be done by policymakers to enable more equitable and affordable access to these medications,\\\" Dr. Ramachandran added.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, making these changes is not easy. Big companies that make the medicines have a lot of power, and they can influence the people who make the rules.\\\\n\\\\nDespite these challenges, more people are becoming aware of the problem and are working to find solutions. Doctors like Dr. Lipska and Dr. Ramachandran believe that they can help by speaking up for their patients and sharing their experiences with those who make the rules.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"There are a lot of policies targeting drug affordability that have recently been proposed or enacted into law,\\\" Dr. Lipska said. \\\"Clinicians can give feedback about how certain solutions are playing out in practice and bring an important perspective to this conversation.\\\"\\\\n\\\\nBy working together, doctors, patients, and those who make the rules can find ways to make these important medicines more affordable for everyone who needs them.\"]];\n",
